# Key Management Service API, REST: AsymmetricEncryptionKey.Update

Updates the specified asymmetric KMS key.

## HTTP request

```
PATCH https://{{ api-host-kms }}/kms/v1/asymmetricEncryptionKeys/{keyId}
```

## Path parameters

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| keyId | **string**

Required field. ID of the asymmetric KMS key to update.
To get the ID of a asymmetric KMS key use a [AsymmetricEncryptionKeyService.List](/docs/kms/asymmetricencryption/api-ref/AsymmetricEncryptionKey/list#List) request. ||
|#

## Body parameters {#yandex.cloud.kms.v1.asymmetricencryption.UpdateAsymmetricEncryptionKeyRequest}

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| updateMask | **string** (field-mask)

Required field. A comma-separated names off ALL fields to be updated.
Only the specified fields will be changed. The others will be left untouched.
If the field is specified in `` updateMask `` and no value for that field was sent in the request,
the field's value will be reset to the default. The default value for most fields is null or 0.

If `` updateMask `` is not sent in the request, all fields' values will be updated.
Fields specified in the request will be updated to provided values.
The rest of the fields will be reset to the default. ||
|| name | **string**

New name for the asymmetric KMS key. ||
|| description | **string**

New description for the asymmetric KMS key. ||
|| status | **enum** (Status)

New status for the asymmetric KMS key.
Using the [AsymmetricEncryptionKeyService.Update](#Update) method you can only set ACTIVE or INACTIVE status.

- `STATUS_UNSPECIFIED`
- `CREATING`: The key is being created.
- `ACTIVE`: The key is active and can be used for encryption and decryption or signature and verification.
Can be set to INACTIVE using the [AsymmetricKeyService.Update] method.
- `INACTIVE`: The key is inactive and unusable.
Can be set to ACTIVE using the [AsymmetricKeyService.Update] method. ||
|| labels | **object** (map<**string**, **string**>)

Custom labels for the asymmetric KMS key as `key:value` pairs. Maximum 64 per key. ||
|| deletionProtection | **boolean**

Flag that inhibits deletion of the asymmetric KMS key ||

An Operation resource. For more information, see [Operation](/docs/api-design-guide/concepts/operation).

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| id | **string**

ID of the operation. ||
|| description | **string**

Description of the operation. 0-256 characters long. ||
|| createdAt | **string** (date-time)

Creation timestamp.

String in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format. The range of possible values is from
`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` to `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z`, i.e. from 0 to 9 digits for fractions of a second.

To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the
[Protocol Buffers reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/overview).
In some languages, built-in datetime utilities do not support nanosecond precision (9 digits). ||
|| createdBy | **string**

ID of the user or service account who initiated the operation. ||
|| modifiedAt | **string** (date-time)

The time when the Operation resource was last modified.

String in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format. The range of possible values is from
`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` to `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z`, i.e. from 0 to 9 digits for fractions of a second.

To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the
[Protocol Buffers reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/overview).
In some languages, built-in datetime utilities do not support nanosecond precision (9 digits). ||
|| done | **boolean**

If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. ||
|| metadata | **[UpdateAsymmetricEncryptionKeyMetadata](#yandex.cloud.kms.v1.asymmetricencryption.UpdateAsymmetricEncryptionKeyMetadata)**

Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.
It typically contains the ID of the target resource that the operation is performed on.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. ||
|| error | **[Status](#google.rpc.Status)**

The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||
|| response | **[AsymmetricEncryptionKey](#yandex.cloud.kms.v1.asymmetricencryption.AsymmetricEncryptionKey)**

The normal response of the operation in case of success.
If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete,
the response is [google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty).
If the original method is the standard Create/Update,
the response should be the target resource of the operation.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the response type, if any.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||
