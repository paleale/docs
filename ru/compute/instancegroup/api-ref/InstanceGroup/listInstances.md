# Compute Cloud Instance Groups API, REST: InstanceGroup.ListInstances

Lists instances for the specified instance group.

## HTTP request

```
GET https://compute.{{ api-host }}/compute/v1/instanceGroups/{instanceGroupId}/instances
```

## Path parameters

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| instanceGroupId | **string**

Required field. ID of the InstanceGroup resource to list instances for.
To get the instance group ID, use a [InstanceGroupService.List](/docs/compute/instancegroup/api-ref/InstanceGroup/list#List) request. ||
|#

## Query parameters {#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.instancegroup.ListInstanceGroupInstancesRequest}

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| pageSize | **string** (int64)

The maximum number of results per page to return. If the number of available
results is larger than `pageSize`,
the service returns a [ListInstanceGroupInstancesResponse.nextPageToken](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.instancegroup.ListInstanceGroupInstancesResponse)
that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. ||
|| pageToken | **string**

Page token. To get the next page of results,
set `pageToken` to the [ListInstanceGroupInstancesResponse.nextPageToken](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.instancegroup.ListInstanceGroupInstancesResponse)
returned by a previous list request. ||
|| filter | **string**

A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
Currently you can use filtering only on the [ManagedInstance.name](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.instancegroup.ManagedInstance) field. ||
|#

## Response {#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.instancegroup.ListInstanceGroupInstancesResponse}

**HTTP Code: 200 - OK**

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| instances[] | **[ManagedInstance](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.instancegroup.ManagedInstance)**

Lists instances for the specified instance group. ||
|| nextPageToken | **string**

This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results
is more than [ListInstanceGroupInstancesRequest.pageSize](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.instancegroup.ListInstanceGroupInstancesRequest), use
`nextPageToken` as the value
for the [ListInstanceGroupInstancesRequest.pageToken](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.instancegroup.ListInstanceGroupInstancesRequest) query parameter
in the next list request. Each subsequent list request will have its own
`nextPageToken` to continue paging through the results. ||
|#
