To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.

If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete,
the response is [google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty).
If the original method is the standard Create/Update,
the response should be the target resource of the operation.
