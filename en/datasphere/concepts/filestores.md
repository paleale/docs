# File storages

_File storage_ is a way to store information that provides quick access to large amounts of data. With file storages, you can store up to 8 TB of data and access it from your {{ ml-platform-name }} notebooks. You can upload datasets, fine-tuning results, [models](models/index.md), logs, and any other files to your file storage.

File storages are not included in the main project storage and are [billed](../pricing.md) separately.

To use your file storages in multiple projects, you can [share](../operations/data//filestores.md#share) your datasets within your community, just like any other resources. To access your file storage from a notebook, remember to first [activate](../operations/data/filestores.md#activate) the storage in the project.
