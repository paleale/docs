## What goes into the cost of using {{ iot-name }} {#rules}

In {{ iot-name }}, you are charged for the number of messages. The message count is rounded up using the following formula:

Message Count = Command Size / 1 KB
```

For example:
* If the command size is 800 B, it is a single message.
* If the command size is 2,800 B (2.73 KB), it is three messages.
