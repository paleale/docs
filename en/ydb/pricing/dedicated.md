# Pricing policy for the {{ ydb-name }} mode with dedicated instances



{% note tip %}




To calculate the cost of using the service, use the [calculator](https://yandex.cloud/en/prices?state=02fcbc53c755#calculator) on the {{ yandex-cloud }} website or see the pricing data in this section.

## What goes into the cost of using {{ ydb-name }} {#rules}

When using {{ ydb-name }} in dedicated mode, you pay for the following:
* Type and size of [storage groups](../concepts/resources.md#storage-groups) allocated for the DB.
* [Computing resources](../concepts/resources.md#resource-presets) allocated to the DB.

Other consumed resources to be additionally paid for:
* Space used in {{ objstorage-full-name }} to store on-demand backups.
* Volume of outgoing traffic from {{ yandex-cloud }} to the internet.

### Using computing resources {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of VM operation in accordance with its class. Exact class characteristics are given in [{#T}](../concepts/index.md).

The minimum billing unit is one hour; for example, you will be charged for 2 hours when using a VM for 90 minutes (1.5 hours).

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

You pay for the following:
* Storage allocated for DB storage groups.
* Space used by on-demand DB backups saved in {{ objstorage-name }}.

  {% note info %}

  For each DB, {{ ydb-name }} automatically creates and stores two full backups for the last two days for free. No fee is charged for storing automatic backups.

  {% endnote %}

The price covers one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per hour (e.g., storing 1 GB for 1.5 hours costs the same as for 2 hours).

## Discount for committed volumes of services (CVoS) {#cvos}

{% include [cvos](../../_includes/mdb/cvos.md) %}

{{ ydb-name }} provides two types of CVoS: on vCPUs and on RAM for the hosts you are planning to use in your DB clusters. In the management console, you can see how much you can potentially save with CVoS at the current consumption level. You can also forecast your monthly payments for the required number of vCPUs and RAM.

{% note info %}

Currently, you cannot order storage or web traffic this way.
