# Trial period restrictions

The trial period is available to businesses only as a means of testing and exploring the cloud infrastructure features. During the trial period, you can use {{ yandex-cloud }} resources with some restrictions.


## Service Level Agreement (SLA) {#sla}

The Service Level Agreement (SLA) does not apply to the trial period. We do not recommend running production applications in {{ yandex-cloud }} during the trial period.


## Support {#support}

Technical support is provided in full during the trial period. For more information, see [Requesting technical support](../../../support/overview.md).
