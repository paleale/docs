## What goes into the cost of using {{ translate-short-name }} {#rules}


### Translation and language detection {#rules-translate-detect}

The cost of using {{ translate-full-name }} is calculated based on the total number of characters submitted in translation and language detection requests within a calendar month ([Reporting period](../billing/concepts/reporting-period.md)). [Translation requests](operations/translate.md) are charged only for text translation. Unless explicitly specified in the translation request, source language detection is included in the translation charge. Language detection will be chargeable if you submit a separate [language detection request](operations/detect.md).
