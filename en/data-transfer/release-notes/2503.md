# {{ data-transfer-name }} release notes: March 2025


## Fixed issues {#problems-solved}

1. Fixed the behavior of the **[Converting column values to strings](../concepts/data-transformation.md#convert-to-string)** transformer.
1. Fixed the query to the [{{ MY }}](../operations/endpoint/source/mysql.md) source to make sure a transfer works correctly with large values of the `gtid_executed` variable.
1. Instead of the `Upload error: context canceled` message, the actual error that caused the transfer to fail is now displayed.
1. Fixed the issue of failing [{{ CH }}](../operations/endpoint/source/clickhouse.md)-to-[{{ CH }}](../operations/endpoint/target/clickhouse.md) transfers when a table contains a field with a Cyrillic name.
1. Fixed parsing while running `DDL CREATE TABLE` for transfers from custom [{{ CH }}](../operations/endpoint/source/clickhouse.md) installations.
1. Fixed the issue with saving a {{ schema-registry-name }} password in the Debezium parser settings.

1. Fixed the export of large files from the [S3](../operations/endpoint/source/s3.md) source.
1. The [{{ yds-full-name }}](../operations/endpoint/target/data-streams.md) target now uses the YDB Topic API. Fixed issues causing the `LB sink write timeout exceeded` and `trying to send message larger than max` errors.
