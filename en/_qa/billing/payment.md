#### I linked a card to my business billing account. When will money be debited from it? {#unlink-card}

If this is your trial period, funds will not be debited from the bank card you linked.
Since you do not automatically upgrade to the paid version at the end of the trial period, funds are only debited after activating the paid version and using {{ yandex-cloud }} services.

If you upgraded to the paid version and used {{ yandex-cloud }} services, do the following to stop incurring charges:

1. Settle your arrears (if any).
1. Delete all billable service resources.
1. Contact [technical support]({{ link-console-support }}) to deactivate your account.


#### I linked a cloud to a new billing account. How do I pay for services now? {#unlink-cloud}

If the [cloud was previously linked](../../billing/operations/pin-cloud.md) to another billing account, check the service usage period. For services provided before the move, pay from the previous billing account. For services provided after, pay from the current billing account. The payment method must match the [billing account type](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types).

#### How is resource consumption charged? {#tariffs}

{{ yandex-cloud }} resources are consumed on an as-needed basis. The amount for resources consumed is calculated individually for each service.

For more information, see [Pricing](../../billing/pricing.md).

#### If I pay an invoice by wire transfer after the end of the reporting period, will my resources be blocked? {#payment-delay}


You can pay within 14 calendar days (not counting public holidays) after the reporting period ends. Depending on which company you contracted with, you can find detailed information in the _Legal Documents_ section for [Iron Hive doo Beograd (Serbia)](https://yandex.com/legal/cloud_customer_agreement/) or [Direct Cursus Technology L.L.C. (Dubai)](https://yandex.com/legal/cloud_customer_agreement_uae/).
 If you pay within this time period, your resources will not be blocked. Remember that it takes up to three business days for your payment to get through, so do not postpone it.
