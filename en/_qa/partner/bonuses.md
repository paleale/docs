# Partner bonus program

#### What is a partner bonus? {#bonus}

A partner bonus is a discount on {{ yandex-cloud }} services applied to the payment invoice issued to the {{ yandex-cloud }} partner's billing account at the end of month. The certificate, payment invoice, and invoice issued to the partner indicate the final amount including the discount.

#### What determines the discount amount, the way it is credited, and how it is calculated? {#discount}

The basic bonus is 10%. With [deal registration](../../partner/program/var-tools.md#deal-reg), you can get up to 15% on top of your partner bonus for as long as the customer remains linked to you.

You can link a customer subaccount to a partner account on the [partner portal]({{ link-cloud-partners }}). Linking a subaccount is grounds for crediting a bonus. It is displayed on the partner portal, in the partner's {{ yandex-cloud }} management console, and in the linked customer's management console.

Linked subaccounts cannot see the partner discount in the management console. {{ yandex-cloud }} does not issue separate payment invoices to subaccounts.

For more information about the discount amount, see the [Partner agreement](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_grant/?lang=ru).

#### What is not included when calculating a partner bonus? {#no-bonus}

The discount does not apply to:

* Partner's own consumption of services in the partner account.
* Consumption of the following services:

  * [{{ marketplace-full-name }}](/marketplace)
  * [{{ mes-full-name }}](../../managed-elasticsearch/)
  * [{{ mmg-full-name }}](../../managed-mongodb/)
  * [{{ interconnect-full-name }}](../../interconnect/)

* Grants credited to subaccounts.

You can view the absolute and relative discounts for a reporting month under **Partner bonus** on the [partner portal]({{ link-cloud-partners }}).

#### Why are resources from {{ marketplace-full-name }} not included when calculating a partner bonus? {#marketplace}

{{ yandex-cloud }} sells {{ marketplace-name }} services with a minimum margin or with no margin at all. Therefore, we cannot provide an additional discount on solutions from {{ marketplace-name }} images.
