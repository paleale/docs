#### What are the advantages of {{ mgl-name }} over a {{ GL }} Community Edition custom installation? {#advantages}

The main advantage of {{ mgl-name }} is that it reduces the installation and administration costs of {{ GL }}. In addition, {{ mgl-name }} adds functionality not found in the [Community Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/) (such as approval rules). For more information, see the [Service advantages over a {{ GL }} custom installation](../../managed-gitlab/concepts/managed-gitlab-vs-custom-installation.md) section.

#### How to migrate data from {{ GL }} to {{ mgl-name }}? {#migration}

You can migrate data from a {{ GL }} custom installation to {{ mgl-name }} by following [this guide](../../managed-gitlab/operations/instance/migration.md). Before you begin, see [how to run migration](../../managed-gitlab/concepts/migration.md).

You cannot migrate data from {{ GL }}.com to {{ mgl-name }}: migration is only available for {{ GL }} installed on a server or local computer (self-managed {{ GL }}).

#### Can I integrate {{ GL }} authentication providers? {#auth-provider}

Yes, you can. To do this, [configure OmniAuth](../../managed-gitlab/operations/omniauth.md).

#### Can I use Yandex ID or Yandex 360 for authentication? {#auth-yandex-id}

Yes, you can. To do this, [add a provider](../../managed-gitlab/operations/omniauth.md#add-provider) of the `Yandex ID` type to OmniAuth and configure its [parameters](../../managed-gitlab/operations/omniauth.md#yandex-id).

#### Is there {{ GL }} integration with {{ tracker-full-name }}? {#tracker-integration}

Yes, there is. For the integration settings, see [Integration with {{ tracker-full-name }}](https://yandex.ru/support/tracker/ru/user/gitlab).

#### Why cannot I push changes to the {{ mgl-name }} repository? {#push}

Error messages:

```text
You are not allowed to push code to this project.
```

```text
You are not allowed to push code to protected branches on this project.
```

To push changes to the {{ mgl-name }} repository, [assign]({{ gl.docs }}/ee/user/project/members/#add-users-to-a-project) the user an appropriate role in the project. To push changes:

* To protected branches (e.g., `master`): `Maintainer` or `Owner`.
* To unprotected branches: `Developer`, `Maintainer`, or `Owner`.

Users with the `Guest` and `Reporter` roles cannot push changes.

For more information about roles, see the [{{ GL }} documentation]({{ gl.docs }}/ee/user/permissions.html).

#### I get 500 Internal Server Error when trying to open the instance. What could be the problem? {#500-error}

The instance disk space may be full. You can [increase the instance disk space yourself](../../managed-gitlab/operations/instance/instance-update.md).

For details, see [{#T}](../../managed-gitlab/operations/instance/clean-up-disk-space.md).

#### How can I clear pipeline logs to free up disk space? {#pipeline-cleanup}

You cannot delete the logs separately. However, you delete them by [deleting irrelevant pipelines](../../managed-gitlab/operations/instance/clean-up-disk-space.md#pipeline-cleanup).

#### Where can I track my disk space usage? {#disk-space}

You can track your disk space:

* In the management console using [instance status monitoring](../../managed-gitlab/operations/instance/monitoring.md#view-graphs) tools.
* In [{{ monitoring-full-name }}](../../monitoring/concepts/index.md), where you can [set up alerts](../../managed-gitlab/operations/instance/monitoring.md#monitoring-integration) based on specified metrics.

#### How do I set up an alert that triggers as soon as a certain percentage of disk space has been used up? {#alert-for-disk-space}

See [Setting up alerts in {{ monitoring-name }} for {{ mgl-name }}](../../managed-gitlab/operations/instance/monitoring.md#monitoring-integration).

#### Why cannot I create backups? {#backup-failed}

If backup creation fails (`Failed` status), [configure a separate security group](../../managed-gitlab/operations/configure-security-group.md) and link it to the {{ GL }} instance.

#### Can I change instance type or disk size after the instance has been created? {#change-type-size}

Yes, you can upgrade your instance to a higher performance type and increase its disk size. However, you cannot reduce instance disk size or switch to a lower performance type. For more information, see [{#T}](../../managed-gitlab/operations/instance/instance-update.md).
