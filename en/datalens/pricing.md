## {{ datalens-name }} service plans {#effective-rules}

{{ datalens-full-name }} features service plans offering different service packages:

* **Community**: Suitable for small teams and non-profit projects.
* **Business**: Suitable for enterprise deployments and business scenarios.

The plan you choose covers your organization and can only be [changed](./settings/service-plan.md#change-service-plan) by its owner or administrator. You pay for all [active users](#active-users).

Service plans offer different feature sets and [cost](#prices) differently.

## Prices for the Russia region {#prices}

The cost of using {{ datalens-name }} depends on the service plan you select.

{% note info %}

If you change to the _Business_ plan, the price for the first month will be proportional to the remaining portion of the month as of the change date.

{% endnote %}

**Active user** {#active-users}

A user is active and subject to billing if their actions have resulted in a query to a data source, e.g., they opened or edited a dashboard, chart, or dataset.

The number of billable users is calculated on a monthly basis: each month, the active users are counted anew. Public URLs to dashboards and charts work without authentication and do not contribute to active user count. You can look up user count in [{{ datalens-name }}](./operations/connection/create-usage-tracking.md) usage statistics.
