{% include [business-note](../../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-functionality-available-business-note.md) %}

The Editor offers multiple visualization types which you can render using various libraries:

* [Table](./table.md)
* [Chart (Gravity Charts)](./chart.md)
* [Markdown](./markdown.md)
* [Advanced chart](./advanced.md)
* [Selector](./controls.md)

Going forward, we will also add the **Yandex Maps** visualization type.
