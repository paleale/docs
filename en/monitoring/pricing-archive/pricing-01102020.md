## What goes into the cost of {{ monitoring-short-name }} {#rules}

When using {{ monitoring-short-name }}, you will only be charged for writing custom metrics via the [API](../api-ref/index.md).

Pricing features:
* After uploading the first 50 million metric values, the writing fee is reduced. See [Prices](#prices).
* {{ yandex-cloud }} resource metrics, as well as incoming and outgoing traffic, are free of charge.

### Prices {#prices}

Service | Price per one million values, <br>incl. VAT
----- | -----
Writing custom metric values via the API<br/>(up to 50 million values) | ₽7.00
Writing custom metric values via the API<br/>(over 50 million values) | ₽4.00
Reading custom metric values via the API | ₽0

### Cost calculation example {#example}

Let's say you write 20 metrics to {{ monitoring-short-name }} at a rate of **1 value per minute**. In 30 days, you will have written the following number of metrics: 

>20 metrics * 1 value/min * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 30 days = 864,000 values = 0.864 million values

The cost of using the service for 30 days will be `0.864 million values * ₽7 = ₽6.05`.

If you write 20 metrics at a rate of **1 value per second** then in 30 days, you will have written: 

>20 metrics * 1 value/second * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 30 days = 51,840,000 values = 51.84 million values

In this case, the cost of using the service for 30 days will be `50 million values * ₽7 + (51.84 - 50) million values * ₽4 = ₽357.36`.
