# Setting up network connectivity in a {{ baremetal-full-name }} subnet

If you set up routing for a [private subnet](../../baremetal/concepts/network.md#private-subnet) and assigned it a [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing), the network interfaces of [{{ baremetal-name }} servers](../../baremetal/concepts/servers.md) connected to this subnet will get IP addresses from the range specified in the subnet’s CIDR settings via [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol).

However, if you did not set up routing for a private subnet, this subnet functions as an [OSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) L2 network, where DHCP does not work, and you need to assign IP addresses manually in the server network interface settings to establish network connectivity. 

This is because the DHCP server becomes part of a private subnet only once the subnet is routable and connected to a [virtual network segment](../../baremetal/concepts/network.md#vrf-segment) (VRF).

{% note info %}

If the server OS is installed from [{{ marketplace-full-name }}]({{ link-cloud-marketplace }}) images, IP address acquisition via DHCP is enabled by default on all physical interfaces of this server.

{% endnote %}

To learn more about networks in {{ baremetal-full-name }}, see [{#T}](../../baremetal/concepts/network.md).

In this tutorial, you will learn how to manually disable DHCP on a network interface from a {{ baremetal-name }} server private subnet and assign it a static IP address. You will also learn to re-enable DHCP on the server's network interface after routing is enabled in this subnet.

In this example, you will use {{ baremetal-name }} servers running Linux [Ubuntu 24.04](/marketplace/products/yc/ubuntu-2404-lts-oslogin). If using another OS, you will need to follow the same steps, but the way you configure network interfaces may differ. For instructions on configuring network interfaces in other operating systems, refer to the relevant OS tutorials.

To configure network connectivity in a {{ baremetal-full-name }} subnet:

1. [Get your cloud ready](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create a private subnet](#create-subnet).
1. [Lease {{ baremetal-name }} servers](#rent-servers).
1. [Manually configure the network interfaces](#setup-interfaces).
1. [Create a VRF segment and enable routing in the private subnet](#setup-vrf).
1. [Enable DHCP on the network interfaces](#re-enable-dhcp).

{% note info %}

Getting servers ready and installing operating systems on them may take up to 45 minutes. The servers will have the `Provisioning` status during this time. After OS installation is complete, the server status will change to `Ready`.

{% endnote %}

## Manually configure the network interfaces {#setup-interfaces}.

As the DHCP server is disabled in the `subnet-m3` private subnet, the {{ baremetal-name }} servers you created were not assigned internal IP addresses, and there is no network connectivity between them.

At this stage, you will connect to the servers and modify the settings of their network interfaces linked to the private subnet by disabling DHCP and assigning them static IP addresses.

No public IP addresses were assigned to the servers, so you cannot connect to them [over SSH](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md). To connect to the servers, you will use the KVM console.

### Configure the network interfaces to use static IP addresses {#enable-static}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder to create your infrastructure in.
  1. From the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_baremetal }}**.
  1. In the row with the `server-m3-1` server, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.label_kvm-console }}**.
  
      You will see an authentication line in the KVM console terminal window that opens:
      
      ```
      server-m3-1 login:
      ```

      If you do not see this line, try [restarting](../../baremetal/operations/servers/server-stop-and-start.md#restart) the server.

      Perform all further actions described in this step in the KVM console terminal:

      1. Specify `root` for the username and press **ENTER**.
      1. Paste the password received when leasing the server in the password input line and press **ENTER**. Note that when typing or pasting a password in Linux, the characters you enter are not displayed on the screen.

          {% include [kvm-paste-tip](../../_includes/baremetal/kvm-paste-tip.md) %}

          Result:

          ```text

          ...
          root@server-m3-1:~# _
          ```

          If you did not save the server administrator password, you can create a new password following this [guide](../../baremetal/operations/servers/reset-password.md) or [reinstall](../../baremetal/operations/servers/reinstall-os-from-marketplace.md) the server OS.
      1. View a list of the server’s network interfaces and find the interface connected to the private subnet:

          ```bash
          ip a
          ```

          Result:

          ```text
          ...
          5: etx2: <BROADCAST, MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc ma state UP group default qlen 1000
              link/ether 00:02:09:35:fd:31 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

                  valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
          ...
          ```

          Since the server has no public IP address, its only active network interface (with the `state UP` status) is the one connected to the private subnet. In the example above, this interface has the `etx2` ID. In the next step, you will assign a static IP address to this interface.
      1. Open the server network interface configuration file:

          ```bash
          nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
          ```
      1. In the file that opens, edit the network interface settings:

          ```yaml
          network:
            version: 2
            ethernets:
              ... # This example shows only the configuration of the interface you need to set up
              etx2:
                match:
                  macaddress: "00:02:09:35:fd:31"
                dhcp4: false # Here, opt out of using DHCP
                addresses: # Set the interface static IP address in this section
                  - 192.168.1.101/24
                set-name: "etx2"
          ```

          For the `etx2` interface, configure the following settings:

          * Change the `dhcp4` value to `false` to opt out of using DHCP and set the interface IP address statically.
          * Add the `addresses` section with the internal static IP address assigned to the server. Each server's address must be unique within the subnet.

              {% note info %}

              {% include [internal-addressing-rules](../../_includes/baremetal/internal-addressing-rules.md) %}

              {% endnote %}

          To save the changes and exit the text editor, press **Ctrl + X** and confirm saving changes to the `50-cloud-init.yaml` file.          
      1. Apply your changes:

          ```bash
          netplan apply
          ```
      1. Make sure the network interface was assigned an IP address. To do this, run the following command and filter the output by the interface ID:

          ```bash
          ip a | grep etx2
          ```

          Result:

          ```text
          5: etx2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST, UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc ma state UP group default qlen 1000
              inet 192.168.1.101/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global etx2
          ```

          The network interface is configured to use the `192.168.1.101` static IP address in the private subnet named `subnet-m3`.
  1. Similarly, configure the `server-m3-2` network interface by assigning it the `192.168.1.102/24` static IP address in the netplan settings.

{% endlist %}

## Enable DHCP on the network interfaces {#re-enable-dhcp}

After you enabled routing in the private subnet and connected it to the VRF segment, a DHCP server started automatically in this subnet. To allow network interfaces of your {{ baremetal-name }} servers to obtain IP addresses via DHCP, you need to enable DHCP in their configuration.

{% note info %}

The DHCP server that serves the VRF-enabled private subnets can only assign IP addresses to physical interfaces of known (trusted) {{ baremetal-name }} servers. Therefore, you cannot assign IP addresses from a private subnet to containers or VMs running on your server.

{% endnote %}

  1. In the row with the `server-m3-1` server, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.label_kvm-console }}**.
  1. Authenticate as the `root` user in the KVM console terminal with the password you saved when leasing the server. Perform all further actions described in this step in the KVM console terminal:
  
      1. Open the server network interface configuration file:

          ```bash
          nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
          ```
      1. In the file, edit the settings of the network interface connected to the private subnet:

          ```yaml
          network:
            version: 2
            ethernets:
              ... # This example shows only the configuration of the interface connected to the private subnet

                set-name: "etx2"
          ```

          Configure the following settings for the interface:

          * Change the `dhcp4` value to `true` to enable DHCP for automatic IP address assignment on this interface.
          * Comment out or delete the `addresses` section with the internal static IP address assigned to the server.

          To save the changes and exit the text editor, press **Ctrl + X** and confirm saving changes to the `50-cloud-init.yaml` file.

## How to cancel server lease {#clear-out}

You cannot delete {{ baremetal-name }} servers. Instead, you can cancel their lease.

To stop paying for the resources you created, [cancel](../../baremetal/operations/servers/server-lease-cancel.md) the lease of the {{ baremetal-name }} servers you created earlier.
