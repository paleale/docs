# Configuring VRRP for a {{ baremetal-name }} server cluster using Keepalived 

{% note info %}

{{ baremetal-full-name }} is at the [Preview](../../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage.

{% endnote %}

[VRRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Router_Redundancy_Protocol) (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) is a network protocol that increases fault tolerance of routers used as a default gateway. 

To implement fault tolerance, two or more routers are grouped into a single virtual router acting as the default gateway for the associated network segments. VRRP enables creating a virtual IP address which is shared among the grouped routers to increase the gateway availability.

This tutorial provides an example of setting up a high-availability proxy server configuration on {{ baremetal-name }} [servers](../../baremetal/concepts/servers.md), where proxying functions are configured symmetrically on two or more [HAProxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAProxy) nodes and a virtual IP address is generated and shared among these nodes using [Keepalived](https://keepalived.org/).

## Solution architecture {#solution-overview}

![bms-vrf-routing-scheme](../../_assets/baremetal/bms-vrf-routing-scheme.svg)

In the `{{ region-id }}-m` availability zone, you will set up an environment of two [private subnets](../../baremetal/concepts/network.md#private-subnet), `subnet-m3` and `subnet-m4`, created in the `{{ region-id }}-m3` and `{{ region-id }}-m4` [server pools](../../baremetal/concepts/servers.md#server-pools), respectively. You will group these subnets into a [virtual network segment](../../baremetal/concepts/network.md#vrf-segment) (VRF) named `vrrp-vrf`.

In `subnet-m3`, you will create two {{ baremetal-name }} servers, `master-server-m3` and `backup-server-m3`, which will have the `MASTER` and `BACKUP` roles, respectively, in the VRRP group. On these two servers, you will run Keepalived and use it to set up a virtual IP address for the server group in the `{{ region-id }}-m3` pool.

In `subnet-m4` of the `{{ region-id }}-m4` server pool, you will create a {{ baremetal-name }} server named `client-server-m4`, which will serve as a client when using the virtual IP address created in the `{{ region-id }}-m3` pool.

This solution fully demonstrates the operation of an isolated client VRF segment with the [OSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) L3 routing between the `{{ region-id }}-m3` and `{{ region-id }}-m4` server pools as well as the L2-level operation of the broadcast VRRP in the `{{ region-id }}-m3` server pool.

{% note info %}

At L2 of the OSI network model, broadcasting works only within one server pool and only for a group of servers in the same network.

1. [Get your cloud ready](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create a virtual routing and forwarding segment](#create-vrf).
1. [Create private subnets](#create-subnetworks).
1. [Lease {{ baremetal-name }} servers](#rent-servers).
1. [Configure Keepalived on the servers of the {{ region-id }}-m3 pool](#setup-keepalived).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost of the proposed solution includes the {{ baremetal-name }} server lease fee (see [{{ baremetal-full-name }} pricing](../../baremetal/pricing.md)).

## Create a virtual routing and forwarding segment {#create-vrf}

To link several private subnets at the L3 level of the OSI network model, you need to group them into a virtual network segment (VRF).

Create a new VRF segment:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder to create your infrastructure in.

  1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.title_section-server-info }}** in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.field_name }}** field, enter a name for the server: `master-server-m3`.
  1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.label_create-server }}**.
  1. Similarly, lease two more servers: one named `backup-server-m3` in the `{{ region-id }}-m3` server pool and another one named `client-server-m4` with the `subnet-m4` subnet in the `{{ region-id }}-m4` server pool.

{% endlist %}

On the page with a list of {{ baremetal-name }} servers that opens, you will see information about all the servers you created. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.field_needed-public-ip }}** field of the table, copy the server public IP addresses as you will need them to connect to the servers over SSH.

{% note info %}

Getting servers ready and installing operating systems on them may take up to 45 minutes. The servers will have the `Provisioning` status during this time. After OS installation is complete, the server status will change to `Ready`.

{% endnote %}

## Configure Keepalived on the servers of the {{ region-id }}-m3 pool {#setup-keepalived}

At this step, you will install, configure, and run [Keepalived](https://keepalived.org/) on the servers created in the `{{ region-id }}-m3` pool.

Follow the steps below to configure both servers, `master-server-m3` and `backup-server-m3`.

1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the server over SSH by using the server’s public IP address you saved in the previous step. 
1. Install Keepalived by running this command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install keepalived -y
    ```
1. View the list of the server’s network interfaces:

    ```bash
    ip a
    ```

    Result:

    ```text
    ...
    5: etx2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:02:c9:35:fd:31 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        altname enp6s0d1
        inet 172.28.1.2/24 metric 100 brd 172.28.1.255 scope global dynamic etx2
           valid_lft 3512sec preferred_lft 3512sec
        inet6 fe80::202:c9ff:fe35:fd31/64 scope link
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    ```

    In the command output, find an interface with an IP address in the `172.28.1.0/24` range allocated for the private subnet named `subnet-m3`. In the example above, such an interface has the `etx2` ID. You will need the interface ID in later steps to configure Keepalived.
1. Create a Keepalived configuration file:

    ```
    sudo nano /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
    ```
1. Add the following configuration into the file you created:

    {% list tabs %}

    - Master

      ```text
      vrrp_instance M3_1 {
          state MASTER
          interface etx2
          virtual_router_id 51
          priority 100
          advert_int 1

          authentication {
              auth_type PASS
              auth_pass hGoVjTjSYQq3Epm
          }

          virtual_ipaddress {
              172.28.1.254
          }

          preempt
      }
      ```

    - Backup

      ```text
      vrrp_instance M3_2 {
          state BACKUP
          interface etx2
          virtual_router_id 51
          priority 90
          advert_int 1

          authentication {
              auth_type PASS
              auth_pass hGoVjTjSYQq3Epm
          }

          virtual_ipaddress {
              172.28.1.254
          }

          preempt
      }
      ```

    {% endlist %}

    Where:

    * `vrrp_instance`: Virtual router name:
    
        * `M3_1` for the server with the `MASTER` role.
        * `M3_2` for the server with the `BACKUP` role.
    * `state`: Server state, `MASTER` or `BACKUP`.
    * `interface`: ID of the network interface where the virtual IP address will be used. In the example above, it is `etx2`.
    * `virtual_router_id`: Unique VRRP ID for the group of virtual routers. This value must be the same for all servers in the group.
    * `priority`: Priority that allows you to set the master and backup nodes. Set a server’s priority to `100` to make it the master node or to `90` to make it the backup one.
    * `advert_int`: Interval between state announcements in seconds.
    * `authentication`: Section with authentication settings to provide security. Contents of this section must be the same for all servers in a group.
    * `virtual_ipaddress`: Virtual IP address that the current node will manage. Virtual IP address requirements:

        * It must belong to the CIDR range allocated for the virtual subnet where you created the server group.
        * It must be unused.
        * All servers in the group must have the same address.
    * `preempt`: Enables the server to change its state to `MASTER` if it has a higher priority than the current master in the group.
1. Restart Keepalived:

    ```bash
    systemctl restart keepalived.service
    ```
1. View Keepalived logs to make sure the service is running:

## Test the solution {#test-solution}

1. Make sure the virtual IP address was added to the network interface of the server with the `Master` role:
    1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to `master-server-m3` over SSH.
    1. View the configuration of the network interface assigned to the `subnet-m3` private subnet.

        ```bash
        ip a
        ```

        Result:

        ```text
        ...
        5: etx2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
            link/ether 00:02:c9:35:fd:31 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
            altname enp6s0d1
            inet 172.28.1.2/24 metric 100 brd 172.28.1.255 scope global dynamic etx2

            inet6 fe80::202:c9ff:fe35:fd31/64 scope link
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        ```

        The network interface received an additional virtual IP address specified in Keepalived settings: `172.28.1.254/32`.

1. Send [ICMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) requests from the `subnet-m4` private subnet to make sure the virtual IP address in the `subnet-m3` private subnet is available:

    1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to `client-server-m4` over SSH.
    1. Run this command:

        ```bash
        ping 172.28.1.254 -s 1024 -c 5
        ```

        Result:

        ```text

        ```

        The command you have used sends and receives packages of an increased size. All packages were delivered in full.

1. Make sure the Keepalived load balancer works correctly:

    1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to `client-server-m4` over SSH.
    1. In a separate terminal window, [connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to `master-server-m3` over SSH.

        Move terminal windows so that you see contents of both windows at the same time.
    1. In the terminal window with the `client-server-m4` session, run `ping` once again without a retry limit:

        ```bash
        ping 172.28.1.254 -s 1024
        ```

        During this poll, stop Keepalived in the terminal window with the open `master-server-m3` session by running this command:
        
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl stop keepalived
        ```
        
        When it stops, observe the terminal window with the `client-server-m4` session. If the virtual IP address was shared successfully, ICMP requests should switch to the backup host almost seamlessly without interrupting the running `ping` command.
        
        {% note info %}

        A minor loss of 1 to 3 packages is acceptable, which may happen when the timer for selecting a new group `MASTER` is triggered and the server is assigned the virtual IP address.

1. Check Keepalived logs on the server with the `BACKUP` role:

    1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to `backup-server-m3` over SSH.
    1. View Keepalived logs:

        ```bash
        sudo journalctl -u keepalived.service
        ```

        Result:

        ```text
        ...

        ...
        ```

        As you can see from the service log and comments, `backup-server-m3` was promoted to the master node when Keepalived was stopped on `master-server-m3`. After resuming Keepalived on `master-server-m3`, the server reclaimed its master role and `backup-server-m3`, again, became the backup node.

## How to cancel server lease {#clear-out}

You cannot delete {{ baremetal-name }} servers. Instead, you can cancel their lease.

To stop paying for the resources you created, [cancel](../../baremetal/operations/servers/server-lease-cancel.md) the lease of the {{ baremetal-name }} servers you created earlier.
