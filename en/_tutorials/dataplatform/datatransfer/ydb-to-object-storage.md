# Loading data from {{ ydb-full-name }} to {{ objstorage-full-name }} using {{ data-transfer-full-name }}


You can migrate data from {{ ydb-name }} to {{ objstorage-name }} using {{ data-transfer-name }}. To do this:

1. [Prepare the test data](#prepare-data).
1. [Prepare and activate your transfer](#prepare-transfer).
1. [Test the transfer](#verify-transfer).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).


## Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The support cost includes:

* Fee for the {{ ydb-name }}. The charge depends on the usage mode:

	* For the serverless mode, you pay for data operations and the amount of stored data.
	* For dedicated instance mode, you pay for the use of computing resources, dedicated DBs, and disk space.
	
    Learn more about the [{{ ydb-name }} pricing](../../../ydb/pricing/index.md) plans.

* {{ objstorage-name }} bucket fee: Storing data and performing operations with it (see [{{ objstorage-name }} pricing](../../../storage/pricing.md)).

* Per-transfer fee: Using computing resources and the number of transferred data rows (see [{{ data-transfer-name }} pricing](../../../data-transfer/pricing.md)).


## Getting started {#before-you-begin}


Set up your infrastructure:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Manually {#manual}

    1. [Create a {{ ydb-name }} database](../../../ydb/operations/manage-databases.md) in any suitable configuration.

    1. [Create an {{ objstorage-name }} bucket](../../../storage/operations/buckets/create.md).

    1. [Create a service account](../../../iam/operations/sa/create.md#create-sa) with the `storage.editor` and `ydb.editor` roles. The transfer will use it to access the database and bucket.

- Using {{ TF }} {#tf}

    1. {% include [terraform-install-without-setting](../../../_includes/mdb/terraform/install-without-setting.md) %}
    1. {% include [terraform-authentication](../../../_includes/mdb/terraform/authentication.md) %}
    1. {% include [terraform-setting](../../../_includes/mdb/terraform/setting.md) %}
    1. {% include [terraform-configure-provider](../../../_includes/mdb/terraform/configure-provider.md) %}

    1. Download the [ydb-to-object-storage.tf](https://github.com/yandex-cloud-examples/yc-data-transfer-from-ydb-to-object-storage/blob/main/ydb-to-object-storage.tf) configuration file to the same working directory.

        This file describes:

        * [Network](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network).
        * [Subnet](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).
        * [Security group](../../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md).
        * Service account with the `storage.editor` and `ydb.editor` roles.
        * {{ objstorage-name }} target bucket.
        * Endpoints.
        * Transfer.

    1. Specify the following in the `ydb-to-object-storage.tf` file:
        * `folder_id`: [Folder ID](../../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md).
        * `bucket_name`: Bucket name consistent with the [naming conventions](../../../storage/concepts/bucket.md#naming).

    1. Make sure the {{ TF }} configuration files are correct using this command:

        ```bash
        terraform validate
        ```

        If there are any errors in the configuration files, {{ TF }} will point them out.

    1. Create the required infrastructure:

        {% include [terraform-apply](../../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

        {% include [explore-resources](../../../_includes/mdb/terraform/explore-resources.md) %}

{% endlist %}

## Prepare the test data {#prepare-data}

1. [Create](../../../ydb/operations/crud.md/#web-sql) the `seasons` table in the {{ ydb-name }} database:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE seasons
    (
        series_id Uint64,
        season_id Uint64,
        title Utf8,
        first_aired Uint64,
        last_aired Uint64,
        PRIMARY KEY (series_id, season_id)
    );

    COMMIT;
     ```
1. Populate the table with data:

    ```sql
    REPLACE INTO seasons (series_id, season_id, title, first_aired, last_aired)
    VALUES
        (1, 1, "Season 1", CAST(Date("2006-02-03") AS Uint64), CAST(Date("2006-03-03") AS Uint64)),
        (1, 2, "Season 2", CAST(Date("2007-08-24") AS Uint64), CAST(Date("2007-09-28") AS Uint64)),
        (1, 3, "Season 3", CAST(Date("2008-11-21") AS Uint64), CAST(Date("2008-12-26") AS Uint64)),
        (1, 4, "Season 4", CAST(Date("2010-06-25") AS Uint64), CAST(Date("2010-07-30") AS Uint64)),
        (2, 1, "Season 1", CAST(Date("2014-04-06") AS Uint64), CAST(Date("2014-06-01") AS Uint64)),
        (2, 2, "Season 2", CAST(Date("2015-04-12") AS Uint64), CAST(Date("2015-06-14") AS Uint64)),
        (2, 3, "Season 3", CAST(Date("2016-04-24") AS Uint64), CAST(Date("2016-06-26") AS Uint64)),
        (2, 4, "Season 4", CAST(Date("2017-04-23") AS Uint64), CAST(Date("2017-06-25") AS Uint64)),
        (2, 5, "Season 5", CAST(Date("2018-03-25") AS Uint64), CAST(Date("2018-05-13") AS Uint64));

    COMMIT;
    ```

        * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.object_storage.console.form.object_storage.ObjectStorageAdvancedSettings.bucket_layout.title }}**: `from_YDB`.

    1. [Create a source endpoint](../../../data-transfer/operations/endpoint/source/ydb.md) of the `{{ ydb-short-name }}` type and specify the DB connection parameters in it:

        * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.ydb.console.form.ydb.YdbConnectionSettings.database.title }}**: Select the {{ ydb-short-name }} database from the list.
        * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.ydb.console.form.ydb.YdbConnectionSettings.service_account_id.title }}**: Select the service account you previously created.

    1. [Create a transfer](../../../data-transfer/operations/transfer.md#create) of the **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.transfer.console.form.transfer.TransferType.snapshot.title }}** type that will use the created endpoints.

    1. [Activate the transfer](../../../data-transfer/operations/transfer.md#activate) and wait for its status to change to **_{{ ui-key.yacloud.data-transfer.label_connector-status-DONE }}_**.

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

    1. In the `ydb-to-object-storage.tf` file, specify these variables:

        * `target_endpoint_id`: ID of the target endpoint.
        * `source_endpoint_id`: ID of the source endpoint.
        * `transfer_enabled`: `1` to create a transfer.

    1. Make sure the {{ TF }} configuration files are correct using this command:

        ```bash
        terraform validate
        ```

        If there are any errors in the configuration files, {{ TF }} will point them out.

    1. Create the required infrastructure:

        {% include [terraform-apply](../../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

    1. [Activate the transfer](../../../data-transfer/operations/transfer.md#activate) and wait for its status to change to **_{{ ui-key.yacloud.data-transfer.label_connector-status-DONE }}_**.

{% endlist %}

## Test the transfer {#verify-transfer}

Make sure the data has been migrated from {{ ydb-name }} to the {{ objstorage-name }} bucket:

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the bucket is located.
1. From the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_storage }}**.
1. Select the bucket from the list.
1. Navigate to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.storage.bucket.switch_files }}** tab.
1. Check that the {{ objstorage-name }} bucket contains the `from_YDB` folder with the `<seasons.csv>` object with test data.

## Delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

Some resources are not free of charge. To avoid paying for them, delete the resources you no longer need:

1. [Delete the transfer](../../../data-transfer/operations/transfer.md#delete).
1. [Delete the endpoints](../../../data-transfer/operations/endpoint/index.md#delete).

Delete the other resources depending on how they were created:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Manually {#manual}

    1. [Delete the {{ objstorage-name }} bucket](../../../storage/operations/buckets/delete.md).
    1. [Delete the {{ ydb-name }} database](../../../ydb/operations/manage-databases.md/#delete-db).
    1. If you created a service account, [delete it](../../../iam/operations/sa/delete.md).
