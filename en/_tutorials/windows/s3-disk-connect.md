# Connecting a bucket as a disk in Windows

In this tutorial, you will use [rclone](https://rclone.org) to set up synchronization of data between an {{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket and your local desktop. The bucket will be mounted as a disk in Windows.

{% note info %}

This section describes how to connect a bucket in Windows. When connecting in other OSs, see the official [rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/install/). For [rclone configuring](#rclone-config) and [bucket mounting](#bucket-mount), follow the same steps used in Windows.

{% endnote %}

To mount your bucket as a disk:

1. [Get your cloud ready](#before-begin).
1. [Set up the runtime environment](#environment-prepare).
1. [Create a service account](#create-sa).
1. [Create a static access key](#create-static-key).
1. [Create a bucket](#bucket-create).
1. [Set up a connection to {{ objstorage-name }}](#rclone-config).
1. [Mount the bucket](#bucket-mount).
1. [Set up the mounting service](#mount-service).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Getting started {#before-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}


### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost for bucket support includes:

* Fee for storing data in a bucket (see [{{ objstorage-name }} pricing](../../storage/pricing.md#prices-storage)).
* Fee for data operations (see [{{ objstorage-name }} pricing](../../storage/pricing.md#prices-operations)).


## Set up the runtime environment {#environment-prepare}

1. Download and install the [winfsp distribution](https://winfsp.dev/rel/) from the developer website.
1. Download the [archive with sysinternals suite utilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/) from the developer's website and unpack it to your local working folder.
1. Download the [Windows Service Wrapper (WinSW) executable file](https://github.com/winsw/winsw/releases) depending on your OS configuration and save it to a separate folder.
1. Download the [archive with the rclone utility](https://rclone.org/downloads/) from the developer's website and unpack it to your local working folder.
1. Add the folders containing the utilities and the distribution to the `PATH` variable. To do this:

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  {% include [terraform-role](../../_includes/storage/terraform-role.md) %}

  {% include [terraform-install](../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

  1. Describe the properties for creating a service account and access key in the configuration file:

     {% include [terraform-sa-key](../../_includes/storage/terraform-sa-key.md) %}

  1. Add a section with bucket parameters to the configuration file and enter the bucket name following the [naming conventions](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md#naming):
  
     ```hcl
     resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "<bucket_name>" {
       access_key = yandex_iam_service_account_static_access_key.sa-static-key.access_key
       secret_key = yandex_iam_service_account_static_access_key.sa-static-key.secret_key
       bucket     = "<bucket_name>"
     }
     ```
     
     For more information about the `yandex_storage_bucket` resource, see the {{ TF }} provider [documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/storage_bucket).
     
  1. Make sure the configuration files are correct.

     1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
     1. Run a check using this command:

        ```bash
        terraform plan
        ```

     If you described the configuration correctly, the terminal will display a list of the resources being created and their parameters. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out. 

  1. Deploy the cloud resources.
  
     1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

        ```bash
        terraform apply
        ```

     1. Confirm creating the resources: type `yes` in the terminal and press **Enter**.

- API {#api}

  Use the [create](../../storage/api-ref/Bucket/create.md) REST API method for the [Bucket](../../storage/api-ref/Bucket/index.md) resource, the [BucketService/Create](../../storage/api-ref/grpc/Bucket/create.md) gRPC API call, or the [create](../../storage/s3/api-ref/bucket/create.md) S3 API method.

{% endlist %}

## Set up a connection to {{ objstorage-name }} {#rclone-config}

1. Open the command line in your working folder as an admin user and run the following command:

   ```powershell
   .\psexec -i -s cmd.exe
   ```

1. In the console that opens, run `whoami` and make sure the session has been started by the system user.
1. Go to the folder with the `rclone` utility and run its configuration session:

   ```powershell
   rclone.exe config
   ```

1. Follow the prompts to create a new connection profile:

   1. Start creating a new profile by entering `n` in the terminal.
   1. Enter the connection name: `s3-connect`.
   1. Select the storage type by entering `4` in the terminal.
   1. Select a provider by entering `1` in the terminal.
   1. Select manual entry of credentials by entering `1` in the terminal.
   1. In the terminal, enter the secret key ID you [got previously](#create-static-key).
   1. In the terminal, enter the secret key value you [got previously](#create-static-key).
   1. Specify the region by entering `{{ region-id }}` in the terminal.
   1. Specify the endpoint by entering `{{ s3-storage-host }}` in the terminal.
   1. You can leave all other settings at their defaults by pressing **Enter** to skip them.

{% note info %}

You can perform advanced connection setup if needed. To do this, type `y` at the `Edit advanced config?` step. For more information about advanced settings, see the `rclone` [documentation](https://rclone.org/s3/).

{% endnote %}

## Mount a bucket {#bucket-mount}

1. Check your connection to the bucket. In the same command line you used to configure the connection, run the following command with the bucket name specified:

   ```powershell
   rclone.exe ls s3-connect:<bucket_name>
   ```

   If the configuration is set up correctly, the objects in the bucket will be listed in the console.

1. Mount the bucket to the file system specifying the bucket name and an available drive letter in the file system:

   ```powershell
   rclone.exe mount s3-connect:<bucket_name> <disk_letter>: --vfs-cache-mode full
   ```
   
   You will see a new disk with the objects from the bucket in Windows Explorer.

1. To mount the bucket, press **Ctrl** + **C**.

## Set up the mounting service {#mount-service}

To mount the bucket at your desktop startup, set up mounting on behalf of the system service. 

1. In the `WinSW` utility folder, create a file named `WinSW-x64.xml` (`WinSW-x86.xml` if you have a 32-bit version of Windows) with the following contents:
   
   ```xml
   <service>
     <id>rclone</id>
     <name>rclone-s3-disk</name>
     <description>This service maps an S3 bucket as a system drive.</description>
     <executable>"<working_folder_location>\rclone.exe"</executable>
     <arguments>mount s3-connect:<bucket_name> <disk_letter>: --vfs-cache-mode full</arguments>
     <log mode="roll" />
     <onfailure action="restart" />
   </service>
   ```

1. In the same folder, open the command prompt as an admin user and run the following command:

   * If you have a 64-bit version of Windows:

      ```cmd
      .\WinSW-x64.exe install .\WinSW-x64.xml
      ```

   * If you have a 32-bit version of Windows:

      ```cmd
      .\WinSW-x86.exe install .\WinSW-x86.xml
      ```

1. Open the Windows services panel and make sure `rclone-s3-disk` is listed:

   1. Press **Win**+**R**.
   1. In the window that opens, enter `services.msc` and click **OK**.
   1. In the list of services, find `rclone-s3-disk`.
   
1. Reboot your desktop and check that the disk is available.

{% note info %}

You can also configure the service to be run by a system user (for more information, see [Service account](https://github.com/winsw/winsw/blob/v3/docs/xml-config-file.md#service-account) in the `WinSW` utility documentation).

{% endnote %}

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources you created:

* [Delete the objects](../../storage/operations/objects/delete-all.md) from the bucket.
* [Delete the bucket](../../storage/operations/buckets/delete.md).
