## Prices before January 1, 2019 {#prices-old}

### Data storage {#prices-storage-old}

Monthly prices are provided for a 30-day month. The price is higher for shorter months and lower for longer months.

Service | Cost of 1 GB per month, without VAT | Cost of 1 GB per month, including VAT
----- | ----- | -----
Standard storage | ₽1.0508 | ₽1.2400
Cold storage | ₽0.5593 | ₽0.6600

Here is an example of proportional calculation. Let's assume a user stores 15 GB of data for 11.5 hours during a 30-day month. The total cost of storage can be calculated using the formula:

```text
Storage_cost = Cost_per_GB_per_month * 15 * 11.5 / 24 / 30
```

Service | Cost, rubles without VAT | Cost, rubles including VAT
