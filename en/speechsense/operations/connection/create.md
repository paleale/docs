# Creating a connection

You can upload a [two-channel audio](#create-connection-audio) or text [chat](#create-connection-chat) to {{ speechsense-name }} connections. To create a connection, you need either the `{{ roles-speechsense-admin }}` or `{{ roles-speechsense-editor }}` role for the space.

## Creating a connection for an audio {#create-audio-connection}

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Go to the space of your choice.
1. In the top-right corner, click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.common.more }}** → ![create](../../../_assets/console-icons/thunderbolt.svg) **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.create-connection-key-value }}**.
1. Name the new connection and, optionally, enter a description.
1. Select the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.type.two-channel-key-value }}** data type.
1. Under **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.dialogs.operator }}**, **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.dialogs.client }}**:

    1. Specify the channels with the agent's voice and customer's voice. The left channel corresponds to audio track 0, while the right channel corresponds to audio track 1.
    1. Specify agent and customer keys from the metadata file. This file contains the call information collected from CRM systems, PBXs, or other sources.

       By default, connections include keys with the name and ID of the agent and the customer. In the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.column.name }}** field, enter a name the key will have in {{ speechsense-name }}. You can also add a description, if required.

       To specify additional metadata for the agent and the customer, click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.add-key }}**.

1. Under **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.fields.metadata }}**, provide the keys from the metadata file that are not related to the agent or the customer.

    By default, connections include required keys with the date, direction, and language of the call. In the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.column.name }}** field, enter a name the key will have in {{ speechsense-name }}. You can also add a description, if required.

    {{ speechsense-name }} can analyze audio recordings in Russian and Kazakh. First it recognizes your recording in Kazakh and then translates the transcript into Russian for further analysis. Each audio metadata must contain a string indicating the languages supposedly used in the conversation. When uploading an audio file in Kazakh, provide the `language: ru-RU, kk-KZ` string in the metadata. For Russian, provide `language: ru-RU`. Language codes are case-insensitive.

    To specify additional metadata, click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.add-key }}**.

    To upload [related dialogs](../../concepts/dialogs.md#related-dialogs) into the connection, add the `ticket_id` string key. The dialogs will be linked by this key. Enter a name the key will have in {{ speechsense-name }}, e.g., `Task number`. You can also add a description, if required.

1. Click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.create-connection-key-value }}**.

## Creating a connection for a chat {#create-chat-connection}

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Go to the space of your choice.
1. In the top-right corner, click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.common.more }}** → ![create](../../../_assets/console-icons/thunderbolt.svg) **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.create-connection-key-value }}**.
1. Name the new connection and, optionally, enter a description.
1. Select the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.type.chat-key-value }}** data type.
1. Under **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.dialogs.operator }}**, **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.dialogs.client }}**, **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.dialogs.bot }}**, specify the keys from the metadata file. This file contains the dialog information collected from chats, CRM systems, or other sources.

    By default, connections include keys with agent's, customer's, and bot's names and IDs. In the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.column.name }}** field, enter a name the key will have in {{ speechsense-name }}. You can also add a description, if required.

    To specify additional agent, customer, and bot metadata, click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.add-key }}**.

1. Under **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.fields.metadata }}**, provide the keys from the metadata file that are not related to the agent, customer, and bot.

    By default, keys with date, direction, and dialog language are added to the connection. In the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.column.name }}** field, enter a name the key will have in {{ speechsense-name }}. You can also add a description, if required.

    {{ speechsense-name }} can analyze dialogs in Russian and Kazakh; it translates the transcript into Russian for further analysis. Each dialog metadata must contain a string indicating the languages supposedly used in the conversation. When uploading dialogs in Kazakh, provide the `language: ru-RU, kk-KZ` string in the metadata. For Russian, provide `language: ru-RU`. Language codes are case-insensitive.

    To specify additional metadata, click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.connections.add-key }}**.

    To upload [related dialogs](../../concepts/dialogs.md#related-dialogs) into the connection, add the `ticket_id` string key. The dialogs will be linked by this key. Enter a name the key will have in {{ speechsense-name }}, e.g., `Task number`. You can also add a description, if required.
