# Vulnerability scanner


Vulnerability scanner is a service that enables you to:
* Statically analyze a [Docker image](docker-image.md) for vulnerabilities in components, libraries, and dependencies used in the Docker image.
* Compare Docker image contents with the [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) vulnerability databases.

Vulnerability scanner only works with Docker images from {{ container-registry-name }}. Users can only scan Docker images they have [permissions](../security/index.md) to.

For scanning, a Docker image is unpacked, and a search is performed for installed package versions (deb). The package versions identified are then checked against a database of known vulnerabilities.

Currently, Docker images are available and built for the following supported operating systems:
* Alpine 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16, 3.17, 3.19, 3.20
* Amazon 2 (Karoo)
* CentOS 5, 6, 7, 8
* Debian 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
* Redhat 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.8, 9.0, 9.1
* Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, 18.04, 20.04, 20.10, 21.04, 21.10, 22.04, 24.06

{% note info %}

Scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities is [charged](../pricing.md#scanner).

## Types of scanning {#types}

You can scan Docker images pushed to a registry for vulnerabilities:
* [Manually](../operations/scanning-docker-image.md#manual): A scan is run by the user.
* [On push](../operations/scanning-docker-image.md#automatically): Docker images are scanned automatically on push.
* [On schedule](../operations/scanning-docker-image.md#scheduled): Docker images are scanned automatically according to a user-defined schedule.
