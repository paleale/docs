# Creating an assistant with a search index

{% include [assistants-preview-stage](../../../_includes/foundation-models/assistants-preview-stage.md) %}

{{ assistant-api }} is a tool for creating [AI assistants](../../concepts/assistant/index.md). It can be used to create personalized assistants, implement a generative response scenario adapted based on external information (known as _retrieval augmented generation_, or RAG), and save the model's request context.

## Getting started {#before-begin}

To use the examples:

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- SDK {#sdk}

  {% include [sdk-before-begin-assistants](../../../_includes/foundation-models/sdk-before-begin-assistants.md) %}

- cURL {#curl}

  {% include notitle [ai-before-beginning](../../../_includes/foundation-models/yandexgpt/ai-before-beginning.md) %}

  To use the examples, install the [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) utilities.

{% endlist %}

## Create an assistant {#create-assistant}

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- SDK {#sdk}

  This example shows how to create an [assistant](../../concepts/assistant/index.md) that relies on information from files for responses. In the example, we will create an index for full-text search and a simplest chat.

  1. {% include [download-context-file-step](../../../_includes/foundation-models/assistants/download-context-file-step.md) %}
  1. Create a file named `search-assistant.py` and paste the following code into it:

      {% include [searchindex-assistant](../../../_includes/foundation-models/examples/searchindex-assistant.md) %}

      Where:

      * `mypath`: Variable containing the path to the directory containing the files you downloaded earlier, e.g., `/Users/myuser/tours-example/`.

      {% include [sdk-code-legend](../../../_includes/foundation-models/examples/sdk-code-legend.md) %}

  1. Run the created file:

      ```bash
      python3 search-assistant.py
      ```

      The example implements the simplest chat possible: enter your requests to the assistant from your keyboard and get answers. To end the dialog, enter `exit`.

      {% cut "Approximate result" %}

      ```text
      Enter your question to the assistant ("exit" to end the dialog): How much is a visa to Bali?
      Response:  300 rubles.

      Enter your question to the assistant ("exit" to end the dialog): exit
      ```

      {% endcut %}

      In the `run.text` property, the AI assistant returned the model-generated response based on the uploaded knowledge base. The `run.citations` property contains [source citations](../../concepts/assistant/index.md#citations), listing the knowledge base files and their fragments used to generate the response.

- cURL {#curl}

  This example shows how to create an [assistant](../../concepts/assistant/index.md) that relies on information from files for responses. In this example, we will show the basic algorithm for working with {{ assistant-api }} via the [REST API](../../assistants/api-ref/index.md) interface: creating an index for hybrid search, creating an assistant and a thread, and submitting a request to the assistant.

  1. Upload the context file for the knowledge base using the [Files API](../../files/api-ref/File/index.md):
      1. {% include [download-context-file-step](../../../_includes/foundation-models/assistants/download-context-file-step.md) %}

          You will use the `bali.md` file from the downloaded archive as the knowledge base in this example.
      1. Encode the `bali.md` file into [Base64]({{ link-base64 }}):

          ```bash
          base64 -i bali.md -o bali-b64coded.txt
          ```
      1. Create a file named `body.json` with the body of the file upload request:

          **body.json**

          ```json
          {
            "folderId": "<folder_ID>",
            "mimeType": "text/markdown",
            "content": "<file_contents>"
          }
          ```

          Where:
          * `folderId`: [ID](../../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) of the folder for which your account has the [`ai.assistants.editor`](../../security/index.md#ai-assistants-editor) and [`{{ roles-yagpt-user }}`](../../security/index.md#languageModels-user) [roles](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) or higher.
          * `mimeType`: [MIME type](../../concepts/assistant/index.md#files) of the uploaded content. In the example, the `bali.md` file's type is `text/markdown`.
          * `content`: Contents of the `bali-b64coded.txt` file you got in the previous step in Base64 encoding.
      1. Send a request to create a file:

          ```bash
          export IAM_TOKEN=<IAM_token>
          curl \
            --request POST \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
            --silent \
            --data "@<path_to_request_body>" \
            "https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/files/v1/files" | \
            jq
          ```

          Where:
          * `<IAM_token>`: IAM token you got [before you started](#before-begin).
          * `<path_to_request_body>`: Path to the previously created request body file (`body.json`).

          Result:

          ```json
          {
            "id": "fvtrdof2njh********",
            "folder_id": "b1gt6g8ht345********",
            "name": "",
            "description": "",
            "mime_type": "text/markdown",
            "created_by": "ajeg2b2et02f********",
            "created_at": "2025-02-06T06:33:08.172814Z",
            "updated_by": "ajeg2b2et02f********",
            "updated_at": "2025-02-06T06:33:08.172814Z",
            "expiration_config": {
              "expiration_policy": "SINCE_LAST_ACTIVE",
              "ttl_days": "7"
            },
            "expires_at": "2025-02-13T06:33:08.172814Z",
            "labels": {}
          }
          ```

          In response, {{ assistant-api }} will return the ID of the downloaded file. Save this file ID (`id` field value). You will need it in the next step.
  1. Create a [search index](../../concepts/assistant/index.md#files):

      1. Create a file named `index.json` with the body of the index creation request by specifying the file ID you got earlier:

          **index.json**

          ```json
          {
            "folderId": "<folder_ID>",
            "fileIds": [
              "<file_ID>"
            ],
            "hybridSearchIndex": {}
          }
          ```
      1. Send a request to create a search index by specifying the path to the new `index.json` request body file:

          ```bash
          curl \
            --request POST \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
            --silent \
            --data "@<path_to_request_body>" \
            "https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/assistants/v1/searchIndex" | \
            jq
          ```

          Result:

          ```json
          {
            "id": "fvtkc1eg493r********",
            "description": "search index creation",
            "created_at": "2025-02-06T06:40:43.288447Z",
            "created_by": "ajeg2b2et02f********",
            "modified_at": "2025-02-06T06:40:43.288447Z",
            "done": false,
            "metadata": null
          }
          ```

          You will get the [Operation](../../../api-design-guide/concepts/operation.md) object's ID in response. Save this ID (`id` field value). You will need it in the next step.
      1. To check your readiness to create a search index, request the operation status by specifying the ID you saved earlier:

          ```bash
          curl \
            --request GET \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
            --silent \
            "https://operation.{{ api-host }}/operations/<operation_ID>" | \
            jq
          ```

          {% cut "Result" %}

          ```json
          {
            "done": true,

          }
          ```

          {% endcut %}

          `true` in the `done` field indicates that the index has been created. Save the obtained search index ID (`response.id` field value). You will need it when creating the assistant and [thread](../../concepts/assistant/index.md#content).
  1. Create an AI assistant:

      1. Create a file named `assistant.json` with the body of the request to create an assistant:

          **assistant.json**

          ```json
          {
            "folderId": "<folder_ID>",

              }
            ]
          }
          ```

          Where:
          * `modelUri`: [URI](../../concepts/yandexgpt/models.md#generation) of the text generation model.
          * `searchIndexIds`: Search index ID you got at the previous step.
      1. Send a request to create an AI assistant by specifying the path to the new `assistant.json` request body file:

          ```bash

              }
            ]
          }
          ```

          {% endcut %}

          In response, {{ assistant-api }} will return your new AI assistant's ID. Save the ID (`id` field value). You will need it when accessing the assistant.
  1. Create a thread:

      1. Create a file named `thread.json` with the body of the request to create a thread by specifying the search index ID you got earlier:

          **thread.json**

          ```json
          {
            "folderId": "<folder_ID>",
            "tools": [
              {

                  "searchIndexIds": [
                    "<index_ID>"
                  ]
                }
              }
            ]
          }
          ```
      1. Send a request to create a thread by specifying the path to the new `thread.json` request body file:

          ```bash
          curl \
            --request POST \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
            --silent \
            --data "@<path_to_request_body>" \
            "https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/assistants/v1/threads" | \
            jq

          Save the obtained thread ID (`id` field value). You will need it later.
  1. Create a message in your thread:

      1. Create a file named `message.json` with the body of the request to create a message by specifying the previously obtained thread ID and the request text in the context of the downloaded knowledge base file:

          **message.json**

          ```json
          {
            "threadId": "<thread_ID>",
            "content": {
              "content": [
                {
                  "text": {
                    "content": "How much is a visa to Bali?"
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          }
          ```
      1. Send a request to create a message by specifying the path to the new `message.json` request body file:

          ```bash
          curl \
            --request POST \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
            --silent \
            --data "@<path_to_request_body>" \
            "https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/assistants/v1/messages" | \
            jq
          ```

          Result:

          ```json
          {
            "id": "fvt94qdq0a0h********",

            "labels": {},
            "content": {
              "content": [
                {
                  "text": {
                    "content": "How much is a visa to Bali?"
                  }
                }
              ]
            },
            "status": "COMPLETED",
            "citations": []
          }
          ```
  1. Run the assistant with the message you created earlier:

      1. Create a file named `run.json` with the body of the request to run the assistant by specifying the assistant and thread IDs you got earlier:

          **run.json**

          ```json
          {
            "assistantId": "<assistant_ID>",
            "threadId": "<thread_ID>"
          }
          ```

      1. Send a request to run the assistant by specifying the path to the new `run.json` request body file:

          ```bash
          curl \
            --request POST \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
            --silent \
            --data "@<path_to_request_body>" \
            "https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/assistants/v1/runs" | \
            jq
          ```

          Result:

          ```json
          {
            "id": "fvtvn4ier4kf********",
            "assistant_id": "fvtuc79tgfsj********",
            "thread_id": "fvt48f07voik********",
            "created_by": "ajeg2b2et02f********",
            "created_at": "2025-02-06T07:29:53.666326755Z",
            "labels": {},
            "state": {
              "status": "PENDING"
            },
            "usage": null,
            "custom_prompt_truncation_options": null,
            "custom_completion_options": null,
            "tools": []
          }
          ```

          {{ assistant-api }} has returned the run information: the launch is in `PENDING` status. Save the run ID (`id` field value). You will need it in the next step.

      1. Get the run outcome with the assistant's response. To do this, make a request by specifying the run ID you got earlier:

          ```bash
          curl \
            --request GET \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
            --silent \
            "https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/assistants/v1/runs/<execution_ID>" | \
            jq
          ```

          {% cut "Result" %}
