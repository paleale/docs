# Error codes

In response to any request, {{ foundation-models-name }} models return a message containing a request processing code and status. If there is an error processing the request, the message will also include its possible cause.

When analyzing the models' responses in your app, go by request code and status. Error messages contain useful information, but may change after model updates.
