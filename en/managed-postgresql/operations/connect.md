# Connecting to a database in a {{ PG }} cluster

You can connect to {{ mpg-short-name }} cluster hosts:

{% include [cluster-connect-note](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/cluster-connect-note.md) %}

{% note warning %}

If only some cluster hosts have public access configured, the master may not be accessible from the internet when it [changes automatically](../concepts/replication.md#replication-auto).

{% endnote %}


## Configuring security groups {#configuring-security-groups}

{% include [sg-rules](../../_includes/mdb/sg-rules-connect.md) %}

Rule settings depend on the connection method you select:

{% list tabs group=connection_method %}

- Over the internet {#internet}

  [Configure all the cluster security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) to allow incoming traffic on port 6432 from any IP. To do this, create the following rule for incoming traffic:

  * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-port-range }}**: `6432`
  * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-protocol }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.label_tcp }}`
  * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-source }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-destination-cidr }}`
  * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-cidr-blocks }}**: `0.0.0.0/0`

- From a VM in {{ yandex-cloud }} {#cloud}

  1. [Configure all the cluster security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) to allow incoming traffic on port 6432 from the security group where the VM is located. To do this, create the following rule for incoming traffic in these groups:

     * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-port-range }}**: `6432`
     * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-protocol }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.label_tcp }}`
     * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-source }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-destination-sg }}`
     * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-sg-type }}**: If your cluster and VM are in the same security group, select `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-sg-type-self }}` (`Self`). Otherwise, specify the VM security group.

  1. [Configure the security group](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) where the VM is located to enable connections to the VM and traffic between the VM and the cluster hosts.

     For example, you can set the following rules for a VM:

     * For incoming traffic:
       * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-port-range }}**: `22`
       * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-protocol }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.label_tcp }}`
       * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-source }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-destination-cidr }}`
       * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-cidr-blocks }}**: `0.0.0.0/0`

       This rule allows you to [connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to a VM over SSH.

     * For outgoing traffic:
        * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-port-range }}**: `{{ port-any }}`
        * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-protocol }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_any }}` (`Any`)
        * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-destination }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-destination-cidr }}`
        * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-cidr-blocks }}**: `0.0.0.0/0`

       This rule allows all outgoing traffic, thus enabling you not only to connect to the cluster but also to install the certificates and utilities your VM needs for the connection.

{% endlist %}

{% note info %}

You can specify more detailed rules for your security groups, e.g., to allow traffic only in specific subnets.

You must configure security groups correctly for all subnets in which the cluster hosts will reside. If security group settings are incomplete or incorrect, you may lose access to the cluster if the master is switched [manually](hosts.md#update) or [automatically](../concepts/replication.md#replication-auto).

{% endnote %}

For more information about security groups, see [{#T}](../concepts/network.md#security-groups).


## Getting an SSL certificate {#get-ssl-cert}

{{ PG }} hosts with public access only support encrypted connections. To use them, get an SSL certificate:

{% include [install-certificate](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/install-certificate.md) %}

{% include [ide-ssl-cert](../../_includes/mdb/mdb-ide-ssl-cert.md) %}

## {{ PG }} host FQDN {#fqdn}

To connect to a host, you need its fully qualified domain name ([FQDN](../concepts/network.md#hostname)). You can obtain it by doing one of the following:

* [Request a list of cluster hosts](../operations/hosts.md#list-hosts).
* In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), copy the command for connecting to the cluster. This command contains the host FQDN. To get the command, go to the cluster page and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.clusters.button_action-connect }}**.
* Look up the FQDN in the management console:

   1. Go to the cluster page.
   1. Navigate to **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.label_title }}**.
   1. Copy the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.host_column_name }}** column value.

Cluster hosts also use [special FQDNs](#special-fqdns).

## Special FQDNs {#special-fqdns}

Alongside [regular FQDNs](#fqdn), {{ mpg-name }} provides several special FQDNs, which can also be used when connecting to a cluster.

In multiple-host clusters, special FQDNs may for some time (up to 10 minutes) point to the old host, even if it has changed its role (e.g., from a master to a replica). If using a special FQDN which points to the current master, some write requests may fail if routed to the replica. This is because it takes time to update DNS records for special FQDNs. Therefore, if using special FQDNs, you should be able to correctly handle situations where a host fails to execute a request because its role has changed. For example, you may repeat your request a little later.

### Current master {#fqdn-master}

An FQDN in `c-<cluster_ID>.rw.{{ dns-zone }}` format always points to the current master host in the cluster. You can request the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

When connecting to this FQDN, both read and write operations are allowed.

{% note info %}

Use master host special FQDN-based connections only for processes that can cope with database being unavailable for writing for up to 10 minutes. 

{% endnote %}

### Most recent replica {#fqdn-replica}

An FQDN in `c-<cluster_ID>.ro.{{ dns-zone }}` format points to a [replica](../concepts/replication.md) that is most up-to-date with the master host. You can request the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

**Specifics:**

* When connecting to this FQDN, only read operations are allowed.
* If there are no active replicas in the cluster, this FQDN will point to the current master host.
* You cannot select replicas whose [replication source is specified manually](../concepts/replication.md#replication-manual) as most recent when using this FQDN.

## Selecting an FQDN and method of connection to a cluster {#automatic-master-host-selection}

You can connect to a cluster using [host FQDNs](#fqdn) or [special FQDNs](#special-fqdns): If the cluster [consists of multiple hosts](../concepts/planning-cluster-topology.md) and has [autofailover](../concepts/replication.md#replication-auto) enabled, keep this in mind when connecting. This is important because the current master can the next moment turn into a replica, and vice versa.

{% note warning %}

If, due to autofailover, a host with no public access becomes a new master or the most recent replica, you will not be able to access such a host from the internet. To avoid this, [enable public access](hosts.md#update) for all the cluster hosts.

{% endnote %}

Use one of these methods to connect to master hosts for reading and writing:

* Connect using a [special FQDN](#fqdn-master) that points to the current master.

    When the master changes, this FQDN may for some time point to the previous master, now a replica, because it takes time to update the DNS record.

    Therefore, if the application uses such an FQDN, it must correctly handle the situation with the master temporarily unavailable. For example, write requests can be repeated after a while.

    {% cut "Connection example" %}

    In this example, we use the `c9qash3nb1v9********` cluster ID:

    ```bash
    psql "host=c-c9qash3nb1v9********.rw.{{ dns-zone }} \
          port={{ port-mpg }} \
          sslmode=verify-full \
          dbname=<DB_name> \
          user=<username>"
    ```

    {% endcut %}

* Connect by listing all cluster hosts and specifying the `target_session_attrs=read-write` parameter.

    {% cut "Connection example" %}

    In this example, all the cluster hosts are listed.

    The host IDs are `rc1a-be***.{{ dns-zone }}`, `rc1b-5r***.{{ dns-zone }}`, and `rc1d-t4***.{{ dns-zone }}`:

    ```bash
    psql "host=rc1a-be***.{{ dns-zone }},rc1b-5r***.{{ dns-zone }},rc1d-t4***.{{ dns-zone }} \
          port={{ port-mpg }} \
          sslmode=verify-full \
          dbname=<DB_name> \
          user=<username> \
          target_session_attrs=read-write"
    ```

    {% endcut %}

Use one of these methods to connect to hosts for reading:

* Connect using a [special FQDN](#fqdn-replica) that points to the most recent replica.

    {% cut "Connection example" %}

    In this example, we use the `c9qash3nb1v9********` cluster ID:

    ```bash
    psql "host=c-c9qash3nb1v9********.ro.{{ dns-zone }} \
          port={{ port-mpg }} \
          sslmode=verify-full \
          dbname=<DB_name> \
          user=<username>"
    ```

    {% endcut %}

* Connect by listing all cluster hosts and specifying the `target_session_attrs=any` parameter.

    {% cut "Connection example" %}

    In this example, all the cluster hosts are listed.

    The host IDs are `rc1a-be***.{{ dns-zone }}`, `rc1b-5r***.{{ dns-zone }}`, and `rc1d-t4***.{{ dns-zone }}`:

    ```bash
    psql "host=rc1a-be***.{{ dns-zone }},rc1b-5r***.{{ dns-zone }},rc1d-t4***.{{ dns-zone }} \
          port={{ port-mpg }} \
          sslmode=verify-full \
          dbname=<DB_name> \
          user=<username> \
          target_session_attrs=any"
    ```

    {% endcut %}

{% note info %}

You can specify the `target_session_attrs` parameter if connecting via a client that uses the `libpq` library.

The `libpq` library supports the `read-write` value for this parameter starting from [version 10](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/libpq-connect.html).

{% cut "How to upgrade the library version used by `psql`" %}

* For Debian-based Linux distributions, install the `postgresql-client-10` package or higher (e.g., using an [APT repository](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/)).
* For operating systems that use RPM packages, use the {{ PG }} distribution available from the [yum repository](https://yum.postgresql.org/).

## Before you connect from a Docker container {#connection-docker}

To connect to a {{ mpg-name }} cluster from a Docker container, add the following lines to the Dockerfile:


{% list tabs group=connection %}

- Connecting without SSL {#without-ssl}

    ```bash
    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install postgresql-client --yes
    ```

    You can find an example of a connection from {{ serverless-containers-full-name }} in [this tutorial](../../serverless-containers/tutorials/pg-connect.md).

- Connecting via SSL {#with-ssl}

    ```bash
    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install wget postgresql-client --yes && \
        mkdir --parents ~/.postgresql && \
        wget "{{ crt-web-path }}" \
             --output-document ~/.postgresql/root.crt && \
        chmod 0655 ~/.postgresql/root.crt
    ```

{% endlist %}


## Examples of connection strings {#connection-string}

{% include [conn-strings-environment](../../_includes/mdb/mpg-conn-strings-env.md) %}

You can only connect to public {{ PG }} hosts using an SSL certificate. Prior to connecting to such hosts, [generate a certificate](#get-ssl-cert).

The examples below assume that the `root.crt` SSL certificate is located in the following directory:

* `/home/<home_directory>/.postgresql/` for Ubuntu.
* `$HOME\AppData\Roaming\postgresql` for Windows.

Connecting without an SSL certificate is only supported for non-public hosts. If this is the case, internal cloud network traffic will not be encrypted when connecting to a database.

You can connect to a cluster using both regular host [FQDNs](../concepts/network.md#hostname) (you can send a comma-separated list consisting of several such FQDNs) and [special FQDNs](#special-fqdns). The examples use a special FQDN of the current master host.

{% include [see-fqdn-in-console](../../_includes/mdb/see-fqdn-in-console.md) %}

{% include [mpg-connection-strings](../../_includes/mdb/mpg-conn-strings.md) %}

If the connection to the cluster and the test query are successful, the {{ PG }} version will be shown. The [userver framework example](#cpp-userver) is one exception, where the `SELECT 1 as ping` test query will be made from time to time to check the {{ PG }} cluster for availability.

{% include [clickhouse-disclaimer](../../_includes/clickhouse-disclaimer.md) %}
