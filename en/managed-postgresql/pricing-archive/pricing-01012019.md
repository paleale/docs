# {{ PG }} pricing policy before January 1, 2019

This is an old version of the policy, valid before January 1, 2020. To learn more about the current {{ mpg-name }} pricing policy, see [Pricing policy](../pricing.md).

## What goes into the cost of using {{ mpg-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mpg-name }} usage cost includes:

   - Disk type and storage size.
   - [Host class](../concepts/instance-types.md) selected for the cluster.
   - Number of DB hosts per cluster.
   - Settings and number of backups.
   - Amount of outgoing traffic.

### DB host usage {#rules-hosts-uptime}

Host operation cost is charged per hour based on host class. You can find detailed class specifications in the [Host classes](../concepts/instance-types.md) section.

The minimum billing unit is one hour (for example, the cost of 1.5 hours of operation is the same as the cost of 2 hours of operation). You do not pay for the time when the {{ PG }} host is unable to perform its main functions.


### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

You pay for the following:

- Storage allocated for DB clusters.
  - You can only order local high-speed storage (`local-ssd`) for clusters with more than three hosts in 100 GB increments.
- Space used by DB backups in excess of the storage amount specified for the cluster.
  - Backups are stored free of charge as long as the combined size of the DB and all backups is smaller than the selected storage size.
  - When performing automatic backups, {{ mpg-short-name }} does not create a new copy but saves the data changed from the previous backup. It means the storage space used by automatic backups only increases in proportion to the volume of changes.
  - The number of hosts in a cluster does not affect the storage size and, consequently, the free volume of backups.

The price covers one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per hour (for example, the cost of storing 1 GB for 1.5 hours is equal to the cost of storage for 2 hours).
