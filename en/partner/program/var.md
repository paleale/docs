# Direct partnership program


_The VAR (Value Added Reseller) program_ is a partner program where a partner company resells {{ yandex-cloud }} services and earns a partner [bonus](#premium).

Partners pay for the services consumed by their customers. Under the VAR program, {{ yandex-cloud }} invoices a partner for the total consumption of services by all its customers. Partners can settle payment invoices in advance (advance payment) or based on the results of consumption (postpaid model). They can also use a [billing threshold](../../billing/concepts/billing-threshold.md).

Program participants:

* Partner: Business residing in the Russian Federation which provides services using {{ yandex-cloud }} technologies.
* Customer: Business that purchases {{ yandex-cloud }} services from a partner (partner's subaccount).

For more information on the tools offered by the program, see [{#T}](./var-tools.md).
