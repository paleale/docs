## What goes into the cost of using {{ serverless-containers-name }} {#rules}

In {{ serverless-containers-name }}, you pay for the number of container invocations, computing resources allocated for the application, downtime of [provisioned instances](concepts/container.md#provisioned-instances), and outgoing traffic.

Computing resources are billed based on the number of processor cores (vCPUs), the [level of core performance](../compute/concepts/performance-levels.md), memory allocated for the application, and application running time:

* The number of cores specified when creating a revision is measured in vCPUs and is a positive real number.
* The core performance level specified when creating a revision is measured in %.
* The memory size specified when creating a revision is measured in GB.
* The total container time is measured in hours and is rounded up to a multiple of 100 ms.

{% note info %}

You are only charged for the container invocations that have caused your application to run.
