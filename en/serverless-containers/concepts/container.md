# Container

A container allows you to run in {{ yandex-cloud }} the application contained in a [Docker image](../../container-registry/concepts/docker-image.md). After creating a container revision, you can invoke it:
* Over HTTPS.
* Using a trigger.
* Using a {{ api-gw-full-name }} extension.

Learn more about [invoking a container](./invoke.md).

## Container revision {#revision}

You can only create a container revision from a Docker image uploaded to a [registry](../../container-registry/concepts/registry) in {{ container-registry-full-name }}. No other registries are supported. The revision contains all the information you need to run the container.

Possible revision statuses include:
* `Active`: Active
* `Obsolete`: Obsolete

Invoking a container triggers the active revision. By default, it is the latest revision, but you have the option to [change the active revision](../operations/activate-revision.md). When you create a new revision, it automatically becomes active.

{% include [manage-revision-note](../../_includes/serverless-containers/manage-revision-note.md) %}

{% include [create-revision-note](../../_includes/serverless-containers/create-revision-note.md) %}

{% include [revision-service-account-note](../../_includes/serverless-containers/revision-service-account-note.md) %}

## Container operation mode {#runtime}

{{ serverless-containers-name }} supports the following container operation modes:

Operation mode | How it works | Result returned when a container is invoked successfully | Data on the HTTP request to a container | Constraints
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**HTTP server** | HTTP requests to the container are received by an HTTP server, which must be running on the port specified in the `PORT` [environment variable](runtime.md#environment-variables). {{ serverless-containers-name }} sets the variable value automatically. | An HTTP response received from the HTTP server. When forwarded to the container, some HTTP response headers [get modified](invoke.md#filter) | Provided in an HTTP request to the HTTP server | â€”
**Commands** | Each HTTP request to the container initiates the `ENTRYPOINT` instructions from a Dockerfile or the commands set when [creating a revision](../operations/manage-revision.md). If the commands are set, they will override the `ENTRYPOINT` instructions from Dockerfile | Response code 200 and termination code in the `X-Task-Exit-Code` response header | Specified in the file located at the path from the`REQUEST_PATH` environment variable | Maximum number of concurrent requests to a single container instance: 1

## Scaling a container {#scaling}

A container instance processes one container invocation at a single point in time. If the container is invoked faster than the instance can process the request, the service scales the container by running additional instances of it. This ensures _concurrent request processing_.

You can [change](../operations/manage-revision.md#create) the maximum number of concurrent invocations of a single container instance and [specify](../operations/scaling-settings-add.md) the number of provisioned container instances.

{% include [provisioned-instances-time](../../_includes/functions/provisioned-instances-time.md) %}

### Provisioned instances {#provisioned-instances}

A _provisioned instance_ is a container instance that is guaranteed not to have a cold start when you run it. In the provisioned instance before the container is invoked:
* {{ serverless-containers-name }} runtime environment components are initialized.
* The user application is loaded and initialized.

{% include [provisioned-instances-price](../../_includes/serverless-containers/provisioned-instances-price.md) %}

If the number of container invocations exceeds the number of provisioned instances, {{ serverless-containers-name }} scales the container within the [quotas](limits.md#functions-quotas), but unprovisioned instances have a cold start when they are first started.

Provisioned instances count towards the following [quotas](limits.md) even when they are not running:
* Number of container instances per availability zone.
* Total RAM for all running container instances per availability zone.	
* Number of provisioned container instances per cloud.
