# Access management in {{ cloud-desktop-full-name }}

{{ cloud-desktop-name }} leverages {{ iam-full-name }} roles and [access control lists (ACLs)](../concepts/acl.md) to manage access. [This example](../concepts/acl.md#example) shows how access management works in {{ cloud-desktop-name }}.

In this section, you will learn:
* [What resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [What roles exist in the service](#roles-list).

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

## Resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

You can assign a role for a [desktop group](../concepts/desktops-and-groups.md) via the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), {{ yandex-cloud }} [CLI](../../cli/cli-ref/desktops/cli-ref/group/add-access-bindings.md), or [API](../api-ref/authentication.md).
