# {{ mch-short-name }} pricing policy from January 1 to March 1, 2019

This is an old version of the policy, valid between January 1 and March 1, 2019. To learn more about the current {{ mch-name }} pricing policy, see [Pricing policy](../pricing.md).

## What goes into the cost of using {{ mch-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mch-name }} usage cost includes:

* Disk type and storage size.

* [Host class](../concepts/instance-types.md) selected for the cluster.

* Number of database hosts in clusters (including ZooKeeper hosts for {{ CH }} clusters).

* Settings and number of backups.

* Amount of outgoing traffic.


{% include [pricing-gb-size](../../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### DB host usage {#rules-hosts-uptime}

Host operation cost is charged per hour based on host class. You can find detailed class specifications in the [Host classes](../concepts/instance-types.md) section.

{% note warning %}

For every {{ CH }} cluster with 2 or more hosts, {{ CH }} automatically creates 3 ZooKeeper hosts.

{% endnote %}


The minimum billing unit is one hour (for example, the cost of 1.5 hours of operation is the same as the cost of 2 hours of operation). The time when the DBMS host or ZooKeeper cannot perform its main functions is not charged.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

You pay for the following:

* Storage allocated for DB clusters.

    * You can only order local high-speed storage (`local-ssd`) for clusters with more than two hosts in 100 GB increments.

* Size of DB backups in excess of the storage set for the cluster.

    * Backups are stored free of charge as long as the total size of the DB and all its backups is smaller than the selected storage size.

    * When performing automatic backups, {{ mch-short-name }} does not create a new copy but saves the data changed from the previous backup. It means the storage space used by automatic backups only increases in proportion to the volume of changes.

    * The number of hosts in a cluster does not affect the storage size and, consequently, the free volume of backups.



The cost is specified for one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per hour (for example, the cost of storing 1 GB for 1.5 hours is equal to the cost of storage for 2 hours).

### {{ CH }} and ZooKeeper {#prices-clickhouse}

You can choose the host class for {{ CH }} and ZooKeeper hosts (as appropriate for the expected replication load).

For example, let's say you created a {{ CH }} cluster with three `s1.micro` hosts but did not specify the class for the ZooKeeper hosts. {{ mch-short-name }} will automatically create three `s1.nano` ZooKeeper hosts.

The price per hour will be calculated using the rates below (including VAT): `3 × ₽5.5119 + 3 × ₽1.7492 = ₽21.78`.
