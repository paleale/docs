# {{ compute-name }} pricing policy from March 1 to May 1, 2019

This is the old version of the pricing policy that expired on May 1, 2019. For the current {{ compute-name }} pricing policy, see [{#T}](../pricing.md).

{% include [currency-choice](../../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}

## What goes into the cost of using {{ compute-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ compute-short-name }} usage cost includes:
* VM computing resources:
    * Type and number of cores (vCPUs).
    * Amount of RAM.
* Operating systems.
* Type and size of storage:
    * Disks.
    * Images.
    * Snapshots.
* Amount of outgoing traffic.
* Public IP address.

### VM usage {#instance}

The cost of a VM depends on the allocated computing resources, operating system, and usage time. Attached disks and network usage are charged separately.

The cost is calculated for the time of using the VM, from the moment it is started (when its status switches to `RUNNING`) until it is completely stopped. The time when the VM is stopped is not charged.

The VM starts automatically once it is created.

When creating a VM, you can specify a public IP address for it.
For information about external IP address usage pricing, see [{#T}](../../vpc/pricing.md) in the {{ vpc-full-name }} documentation.

#### Computing resources {#instance-resources}

When creating a VM, you specify the number of vCPUs, the basic level of core performance, and the amount of RAM in GB. For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/performance-levels.md).

The basic level of vCPU performance depends on the [platform](../concepts/vm-platforms.md) you select.

{{ price-per-hour-count-per-second }}

#### Operating systems {#instance-os}

OS usage on a VM is also charged. The cost depends on the OS license and the amount of computing resources. The core usage type selected for the VM also matters.

{{ price-per-hour-count-per-second }}

#### Cost calculation example {#example-of-cost-calculation}

Let's compare the cost of running VMs on the Intel Broadwell [platform](../concepts/vm-platforms.md) with different [vCPU performance levels](../concepts/performance-levels.md).

Two VMs were created running Linux OS:

* 5% of vCPU and 1 GB RAM
* 100% of vCPU and 1 GB RAM

Both VMs have been running for 30 days.

VM cost with 5% vCPU:

> 5% vCPU = ₽0.1932/hour * 30 days * 24 hours = ₽139.1040
>
> 1 GB RAM = ₽0.2441/hour * 30 days * 24 hours = ₽175.7520
>
> Total: ₽314.8560

VM Cost with 100% vCPU:

> 1 vCPU = ₽0.7017/hour * 30 days * 24 hours = ₽505.2240
>
> 1 GB RAM = ₽0.2441/hour * 30 days * 24 hours = ₽175.7520
>
> Total: ₽680.9760

As you can see, the cost of the VM using 5% vCPU is about half as much as that of the VM using 100% vCPU.

### Storage usage (disks, snapshots, and images) {#disk}

When creating a disk, you specify its size, meaning the amount of block storage that the disk occupies. The cost of the service depends on the amount of time between when the disk is created and deleted, the amount of disk space, and the disk type selected during creation.

You pay for your disks whether the VM is running or not.

If you created an image or snapshot, you pay for the storage of this object separately depending on its size.

The price covers one month of use. You are charged per second of usage.

### {{ ig-name }} usage {#instance-groups}

The {{ ig-name }} component can be used free of charge. You can create instance groups and use the storage and computing resources within the [available limits](../concepts/limits.md).

All other {{ yandex-cloud }} services, such as VMs and external IP addresses, are charged as usual. Outgoing traffic [is charged](#prices-traffic) the same as in other services.
