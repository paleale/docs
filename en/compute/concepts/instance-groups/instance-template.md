# Instance template

When creating a group, you need to describe an _instance template_, which is the basic instance configuration used for deploying all instances in the group.

Both the template and [policy](policies/index.md) description are provided to the CLI in a YAML file using the `--file` flag when creating or updating an instance group. This is a convenient method to provide values that consist of multiple strings. For more information, see [{#T}](../../operations/instance-groups/create-fixed-group.md).

You can set variable values for the instance template. For more information, see [{#T}](variables-in-the-template.md).

## Computing resources {#types}

When describing a template, you specify the computing resources to allocate to each instance, i.e., the number and guaranteed performance of processor cores (vCPUs) and the amount of RAM. You can choose the computing resources that are appropriate for the expected load. For more information, see [{#T}](../performance-levels.md).

You can also use configure the template to create [preemptible](../preemptible-vm.md) instances, which are cheaper than regular ones. Preemptible instances can only be autohealed if there is enough computing resources in the availability zone. If the resources are insufficient, {{ ig-name }} will resume autohealing as soon as the resources become available; this, however, may take a longer time.

You can enable a [software-accelerated network](../software-accelerated-network.md) for group instances. This will transfer the processing of VM network traffic to additional compute cores.

## Disks and file storages {#disks}

Each instance must have at least one disk attached, which is a boot disk. Each boot disk is created automatically and attached to a single instance when creating an instance group. For more information, see [{#T}](../disk.md).

You can also attach additional disks to each instance. You can create an additional disk along with an instance group. You can create an empty disk or restore it from a snapshot or an image. You can only attach or detach additional disks when creating or updating a group. You can [update secondary disks](./deploy/secondary-disk.md) by updating [YAML specification](./specification.md).

{% note alert %}

When you delete a VM, its disks are also deleted from the group. You can delete VMs during [scaling](scale.md) and [automatic recovery](autohealing.md).

{% endnote %}

In addition to disks, you can also attach [file storages](../filesystem.md) to instances within a group. File storages allow configuring an instance to handle [stateful workloads](./stateful-workload.md) by saving the states of applications running on the instance to the storage independent of the instance group.

After attaching a file storage to a VM in the group, [mount](../../operations/filesystem/attach-to-vm.md) it on the VM's operating system. You can attach file storages using the [CLI](../../../cli/quickstart.md), [{{ TF }}](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md), or [API](../../api-ref/). For more information, see [{#T}](../../operations/instance-groups/create-with-filesystem.md).

## Network {#network}

When creating a group, you can:

* Set the network for the entire group.
* Set subnets for each instance in the group.

A [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) used to perform operations in {{ ig-name }} should have a [role](../../../vpc/security/index.md) for accessing network and subnets where the instance group is located. For more information, see [{#T}](access.md).

You can create a group without specifying any subnets for its instances if the availability zone selected for each instance contains exactly one subnet for the specified network.

{% note info %}

In addition to subnets created by you, a cloud network can host automatically created subnets. For example, the [{{ sf-name }}](../../../functions/concepts/networking.md#user-network), [{{ serverless-containers-name }}](../../../serverless-containers/concepts/networking.md), and [{{ api-gw-name }}](../../../api-gateway/concepts/networking.md#user-network) service subnets, or [reserved addresses](../../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/network.md#network-resources) for {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster pods and services.

{% endnote %}

You can also configure a public IP address for each instance. This allows the instance to connect to other services over the internet. For more information, see [{#T}](../network.md).

You can specify the [appropriate security groups](../../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) in a template or configure them individually for each instance in the group.

## Metadata {#metadata}

You can use a template to describe the metadata service parameters and the VM metadata for the instances in the group. For example, in the `user-data` key, you can describe the system users to be added or the [software installation scripts](../../operations/vm-create/create-with-cloud-init-scripts.md#examples) to be run when creating a new VM. Read more about the metadata supported by {{ compute-name }} in [{#T}](../vm-metadata.md).

## Template description in a YAML file {#instance-template}

A template describes the configuration of the base instance. It is defined in the `instance_template` key in a YAML file.

Here is how a YAML file entry may look like:
