# Integrating an instance group with {{ network-load-balancer-name }} or {{ alb-name }}

Using [{{ network-load-balancer-full-name }}](/services/network-load-balancer) and [{{ alb-full-name }}](/services/application-load-balancer), you can evenly distribute the workload across {{ compute-full-name }} VM instances. An [instance group](index.md) can be integrated with these services: {{ compute-name }} will automatically create a {{ network-load-balancer-name }} or {{ alb-name }} target group from this instance group and perform monitoring so that unhealthy instances are not added to the group.


## How integration works {#principles}

### Creating a target group {#principles-creation}

In {{ yandex-cloud }} load balancing services, a _target group_ is a set of resources where your network applications are running. The load balancer the target group is linked to distributes incoming requests across its resources. To learn more about target groups, see the [{{ network-load-balancer-name }}](../../../network-load-balancer/concepts/target-resources.md) and [{{ alb-name }}](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/target-group.md) documentation.

Target groups usually include {{ compute-name }} VM instances. This allows you to set up an instance group so that a {{ network-load-balancer-name }} or {{ alb-name }} target group could be created automatically from it. The target group created this way will be associated with the instance group:

* When an instance is added to the instance group or restarted after being stopped, it is added to the target group.
* When an instance is stopped or removed from the instance group, it is removed from the target group.

To make sure the target group starts receiving traffic, link it to a load balancer. {{ compute-name }} does not do this automatically. 

* The {{ network-load-balancer-name }} target group should be [linked to the load balancer](../../../network-load-balancer/operations/target-group-attach.md) directly.
* The {{ alb-name }} target group should be linked to a [backend group](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md) and the backend group, to the load balancer, either directly or via an [HTTP router](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/http-router.md), depending on the load balancing type. For more information, see our [guides for managing {{ alb-name }} resources](../../../application-load-balancer/operations/index.md).


### Health checks from load balancers {#principles-health-checks}

Once a target group is linked to a load balancer, it sends _health checks_ to the group instances to find out which of them are healthy and which are not when distributing traffic. To learn more about health checks, see the [{{ network-load-balancer-name }}](../../../network-load-balancer/concepts/health-check.md) and [{{ alb-name }}](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md#health-checks) documentation.

When you add an instance to the group or restart a stopped one, this instance is added to the target group, gets the [`OPENING_TRAFFIC` status in the instance group](statuses.md#vm-statuses), and starts receiving health checks from the load balancer. If the instance passes the required number of health checks (the healthy threshold you set when configuring health checks), the load balancer considers it healthy. The instance starts receiving traffic from the load balancer and switches to the `RUNNING_ACTUAL` status.

By default, an instance may have the `OPENING_TRAFFIC` status indefinitely until it gets healthy. You can limit this time in the [integration settings](#settings) (the `max_opening_traffic_duration` field). {{ compute-name }} will then automatically recover the instance that has received no traffic for too long since it was added to the group or started. For more information about VM recovery, see [{#T}](autohealing.md#healthcheck-cases).

You can disable load balancer health checks using the `ignore_health_checks` parameter. In this case, the checks will not affect the instance group in any way.Â Negative check results will not prompt the instances to autoheal, and the group will receive no traffic from load balancers.

{% cut "Ignoring load balancer health checks" %}

Ignoring health checks may be useful in blue-green deployments, e.g.:

1. There are two instance groups connected to the load balancer that serve as target groups:

    * The _blue_ instance group hosts the stable version of the app available to users. {{ ig-name }} automatically restores instances in this group if they fail load balancer health checks.
    * The _green_ instance group is used to test the next application version. This group is set up to ignore load balancer health checks.

1. Load balancer health checks are intentionally configured so that the green instances fail them and receive no user traffic. However, these checks have no effect on the deployment of instances in the group. User traffic only goes to the blue group instances.
1. To transfer user traffic to the new app version tested in the green group:

    1. Load balancer health checks are reconfigured for the green instances to pass them and start receiving user traffic.
    1. To enable autohealing for green instances that fail load balancer health checks, ignoring health checks is disabled in this group.
    1. Load balancer health checks are reconfigured for the blue instances to fail them and stop receiving user traffic.
    1. In the blue group, ignoring load balancer health checks is enabled.

Now the blue instance group will be used for testing, and the green one will receive user traffic.

{% endcut %}

## Settings {#settings}

You can integrate an instance group with {{ network-load-balancer-name }} or {{ alb-name }} in the management console or describe the integration in the group's [YAML specification](specification.md) to provide the specification through the {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI or API. You can specify the settings when [creating](../../operations/index.md#ig-create) or [updating](../../operations/index.md#ig-control) a group.

An instance group can only be integrated with one of the services: either {{ network-load-balancer-name }} or {{ alb-name }}. You cannot set up integration of an instance group with both services at the same time.

Below, you can find the descriptions of the fields with the settings from the YAML specification and their respective fields in the management console.

### Settings for integration with {{ network-load-balancer-name }} {#settings-nlb}

```yaml
load_balancer_spec:
  target_group_spec:

    labels:
      foo: "baz"
      bar: "baz"
  max_opening_traffic_duration: 30s
  ignore_health_checks: false
```

The fields and options in the management console are located under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_ylb }}** on the instance group creation and editing pages.
