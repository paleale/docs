# API methods

[{{ yandex-cloud }} APIs](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/cloudapi) use a set of methods for resource management. Each gRPC call is mapped to a particular HTTP method. For example, the `List` call is mapped to the `GET` method, and the `Create` call is mapped to the `POST` method. Mapping to HTTP requests is specified in a method's description in [google.api.http](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto) annotation.

There are two sets of methods in APIs:
