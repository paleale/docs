{% note warning %}

You may skip the bank card linking step in the billing account creation form if it is optional. However, keep in mind that in this case you will not be eligible for the [initial grant](../../billing/concepts/bonus-account.md), even if you link a card later. You will be able to work with paid resources in the cloud only after you [top up your personal account](../../billing/operations/pay-the-bill.md).
