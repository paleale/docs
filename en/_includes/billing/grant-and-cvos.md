{% note info %}

If you have [grants](../../billing/concepts/bonus-account.md), you can use them to cover the cost of using the committed services, including during the [CVoS](../../billing/concepts/cvos.md) validity period. In this case, the discount on the use of the reserved amount of services will be applied first, and then the grant money will be spent.
