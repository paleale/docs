# Response status codes

In response to a request, {{ speechkit-name }} returns a message containing the request code and processing status. If there is an error processing the request, the message will also include its possible cause.

When analyzing the models' responses in your app, go by request code and status. Error messages contain useful information but may change after you update the service.
