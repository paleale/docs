**Escalation policy** is a sequence of notifications to send when an alert gets the **Alarm** status. If a notification is not acknowledged within the specified period, the system will automatically send it using a different method. Escalation thus guarantees that you or your team do not miss an important message.

You can include any number of steps in your notification sequence, set delays between them, select notification methods, and specify users. For example, it can start by sending a notification to an employee's email or messenger, call them after five minutes, and escalate to their supervisor after ten.
