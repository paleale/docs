## Access management {#about-access-control}

[{{ iam-full-name }}](../../iam/) checks all transactions in {{ yandex-cloud }}. If an entity does not have required permissions, this service returns an error.


To grant permissions for a resource, assign the appropriate resource [roles](../../iam/operations/roles/grant.md) to an entity performing operations, such as a Yandex account, [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), [federated users](../../iam/concepts/federations.md), [user group](../../organization/operations/manage-groups.md), [system group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md), or [public group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/public-group.md). For more information, see [{#T}](../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md).
