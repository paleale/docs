If not planning to use [{{ interconnect-name }}](../../interconnect/concepts/index.md) or [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) for connections to an external cluster, make such cluster accessible from the Internet from [IP addresses used by {{ data-transfer-name }}](../../overview/concepts/public-ips#virtual-private-cloud).

For details on linking your network up with external resources, see [this concept](../../data-transfer/concepts/network.md#source-external).
