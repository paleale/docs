^1^ The time zone is [UTC+3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B03:00).

> For example, if the quota is 100,000 requests per day, you can send a maximum of 10,000 requests per hour from 11:00:00 to 22:59:59 (approximately 3 requests per second) and a maximum of 40,000 requests (approximately 11 requests per second) from 08:00:00 to 08:59:59. 
> If you increase your daily quota of requests to 200,000, you can send a maximum of 20,000 requests per hour from 11:00:00 to 22:59:59 (approximately six requests per second) and a maximum of 80,000 requests (approximately 22 requests per second) from 08:00:00 to 08:59:59.
