One resource unit supports these peak performance thresholds:

* 1000 requests per second (RPS).
* 4000 concurrently active connections.
* 300 new connections per second.
* 22 MB (176 Mbit) of traffic per second.

The system automatically scales the resource unit group based on the load balancer nodeâ€™s external workload. The system calculates the group size to ensure resource unit utilization remains below specified thresholds.
