When designing a cloud infrastructure, it is important to take quotas and limits into consideration. {{ quota-manager-name }} allows you to manage quotas of your {{ yandex-cloud }} services using different interfaces. Some services, e.g., {{ speechkit-name }}, are not available in {{ quota-manager-name }}.

**Quotas** are limits on the number of resources you can use in your cloud. These are organizational constraints that can be changed as needed. Quotas help you avoid overspending and excessive use of resources through sensible budget planning and consumption management.

There are two terms that describe the use of quotas:

* **Quota limit**: Current limit in place for a cloud or organization resource.

* **Quota usage**: Amount or size of the actually used resource.
